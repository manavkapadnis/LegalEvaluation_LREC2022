received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for
his possession. Accused has not given any account in respect of articles
seized from his possession. Therefore, presumption under Section

to be dismissed. Hence, to meet the ends of justice, following order is
passed. Fine amount already paid before the trial Court.
