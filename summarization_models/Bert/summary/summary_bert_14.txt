R/o. House No.4-140, Vijay Laxmi Street,
Humnabad, Dist. The prosecution case is that the complainant is resident of Kalyan, District Thane. Bhiwandi wherein electronic goods of various companies are
stored. The complainant
immediately rushed to the spot. On
completing investigation charge sheet has been filed. It is a weak piece of evidence and requires
corroboration. Learned counsel for applicant in BA No.3352 of 2018 submitted that there is no evidence to
establish his link with the crime syndicate. The prosecution is
relying on the confession of the co-accused which is not corroborated by any evidence. It is further
submitted that there is no identification parade identifying the applicant as the person 4 of 6
904.BA.3352.2018.doc who is involved in the crime. Even there is no CDR record
to show his involvement in the crime. It is submitted that at the most
the involvement of applicant can be attributed to the charge of receiver of stolen property. It is further submitted that the evidence of
witnesses relied upon by prosecution suffers from various infirmities in the nature of contradiction
and it is difficult to accept the said evidence. It is submitted that there is no parade to corroborate
the involvement of applicant in the crime. It is submitted that in the confessional
statement of the co-accused it is indicated that the applicant in Bail Application No.3352 of 2018
had brought tempo which was used in commission of crime. It is further submitted that one another
case is registered against applicants in Bail Application No.1510 of 2018 and 1924 of 2018. Similarly as far as applicant in Bail
Application No.1510 of 2018 is concerned, except confessional statement recorded u/s 18 of MCOC
Act of co-accused, there is no evidence against the applicant. Investigation is completed and charge sheet is filed. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and nature of evidence against the applicants
in these applications, the rigors of Section 21(4) of MCOC Act would not be attracted in present
cases. Hence, case for grant of bail is made out. (PRAKASH D. NAIK, J.) MST
