DATE : 29.05.2019. The appeal is being heard since last about two days. 1,000/- or in default Judgment 2
Cri.apeal609.2015.odt to suffer simple imprisonment for two months. Both the sentences
are to run concurrently. Prosecution commenced on its
basis and conviction, therefore, cannot be sustained. He states that complainant PW-1 Keshav s/o Amrut had sought advance from his Provident Fund
amount for performing marriage of his daughter. However, thereafter, he incorrectly and falsely represented that
the marriage of his daughter was postponed initially to 27th August, 1996, and thereafter pointed
out that it was postponed to 10th October, 1996. 2,000/- from him as bribe for
sanctioning loan of Rs. He submits that PW-4 Biradar Sinha examined by prosecution shows that at 11:00 am accused was
not in his seat and when he returned, again he did not see anybody in the office. Evidence on record creates doubt about giving of signal. 300/recovered allegedly from shirt pocket of accused was kept in one envelope. However, when
prosecutor opened that envelope, amount of Rs. Learned counsel states that amount of Rs. 800/- is stated to be agreed amount of bribe and as
per prosecution in trap, Rs. This runs counter to story of complainant. He further states that role of accused in the process of sanctioning of marriage advance has not
been brought on record at all. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/

Judgment 6 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Evidence of PW-6 Ashok Pohankar shows that he was dealing
with marriage advance cases and charge was not given to accused at all. 25 shows recovery of 8 notes and its recording commenced at 12:30 hours. Other Officers were also present but no outsiders was
present. Learned counsel
states that despite this, the signature of both Panch witnesses namely PW-2 Devrao Maudekar, and
one Shri G.J. Pendhari appear on Panchanama (Part-2) as also on recovery memo Exh. 24 & 25 needs to be discarded as they do not inspire
confidence at all. The attention of Court is invited to fact that no inventory of documents allegedly seized from
table of accused has been prepared by the Judgment 7 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Investigating Officer
and no such list is proved before Trial Court. However, this fact is also not proved on
record. District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra
Pradesh and anr. There is no challenge to these documents. The contention that marriage had taken
place in May 1996 itself has got no bearing on the controversy. This
postponement again is therefore not relevant. According to her, the defence of total denial in such circumstances is of no assistance to accused. The seizure of his shirt is not disputed by him specifically. The learned counsel states that neither Investigating Officer nor Panch had any adverse interest
against the appellant, and therefore, absence of relevant entries in visit book or then mention of
proper details in Panchanama, cannot enure to the benefit of accused. It will be appropriate to first consider the technical objection that consent at Exh. 33 dated 24.04.1997 contains narration of previous history as disclosed in his
complaint at Exh. This authority in examination-in-chief has pointed out that it received papers, went through it,
applied mind and came to the conclusion prima facie that bribe was accepted. Authority also accepts that designation of authority was typed with
carbon. In paragraph 19 full and
careful examination of material in regard to allegations against accused and of circumstances of the
case is also mentioned. Authority granting sanction is not required
to consider the probable defence at all. Therefore, exercise of according sanction vide Exh. P.C. examination or then suggestion given to
witnesses during examination, do not bring on record, any specific defence. 24 & 25 derogates from
transparency and vitiates the entire exercise. 25 is the recovery memo of 8 currency notes and it is recorded on 11.10.1996. This Panchanama is duly proved by the prosecution and crossJudgment 13 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt examination does not bring on record the fact that it has been
falsely prepared. 24 began at 12:30 hours and it was over at 15:00 hours. Then it points out process of obtaining
hand-wash and personal search of accused as also personnel search of complainant. The seizure memo therefore has not been exhibited and accused has not relied upon that seizure
memo. Accused only relies upon mention of that seizure in Panchanama (Part-2). Accused has not given any specific suggestion to bring on
record, the fact that Shri Maudekar and Shri Pendhari were also not present in the office at that
time. The fact that initial loan application was
moved sometime in May 1996 is not in dispute, fact that loan was ultimately received by complaint
two or three days after actual raid is also not in dispute. Fact that marriage was already over in May
1996 is brought on record by accused in cross-examination of complaint. 21, which mention the proposed date of marriage to be 10.10.1996 or 27.08.1996 are also
not in dispute. The two registers in the office of CMPF i.e. Claim Register for October 1996 and Pay Order
Register for that month are not in dispute. 47 and in pay order register, entry dated 03.10.1996 is at Exh. The relevant entry has been marked at Exh. This witness has also deposed in Column No. There
is no challenge in cross-examination to this averment. Only suggestion given to this witness is that
entry at Exh. It is not
necessary to delve more into this aspect. 48 shows his association with the process. 11, hearding is about initials of dealing clerk. This complaint is signed by complainant and also by two witnesses. The steps to
arrange for trap were initiated thereafter. In this situation, if steps to draw prepartory Panchanama (Part-1) were initiated simultaneously
to save the time, no fault can be found it. It is to be noted that the Panchanama (Part-2) shows that at 11:55
hours, accused and complainant were seen coming out of office complex and proceeding to
residential quarters. When he returned back, he did
not see anybody. This person, therefore, does not state that raid was conducted in the office. Who were the people
making inquiry or shouting in loud voice is not clear. Accused has not cross-examined PW-4 in this
respect. His deposition and time factor therefore is irrelevant and does not bring on record any
material inconsistency. In the light of Section 20, his defence of total denial, therefore, is unsustainable. Few more judgment are cited by parties for this purpose however, in present matter, I do not find it
necessary to dwell on it. State of M.P.,
reported in (2007)7 SCC 625 deals with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The recent judgment, reported in (2018)9 SCC 242 - State of Gujrat Vs. Accused also told Shri Moudekar
not to accompany them. This unforeseen situation therefore may have created some practical
difficulties. Raiding party had also taken position and saw the signal. As the matter is old, both the learned Advocates have assisted the system by appearing in
vacation and arguing the matter threadbare. The matter otherwise would not have been heard for
long time, after reopening of Court. In this situation, I am inclined to continue the bail orders
passed by this Court on 24.11.2005. It shall cease
to operate automatically thereafter. Thus, after the said period appellant shall be duty bound to surrender to his bail bounds, if there
are no court orders to the contrary.
