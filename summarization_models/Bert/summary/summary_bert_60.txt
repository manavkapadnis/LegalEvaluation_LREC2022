Allahabad High Court
Kanwar Pal Singh vs State Of U.P. And Anr on 22 July, 2019
Bench: Raj Beer Singh

HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD

? P.C. In well celebrated judgment reported in AIR 1992
SC 605 State of Haryana and others Vs. (2) Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
156(2) of the Code. Keeping in view the above stated settled position of law in the instant case, perusal of record shows
that there are allegations against the applicant that applicant was indulging in illicit mining and
theft of sand. In the case of State of
NCT of Delhi vs. Sanjay 2014 AIR SCW 5487 cited by the learned counsel, it was held that in a case
where there is theft of sand and gravels from the Government land, the police can register a case,
investigate the same and submit a final report under Section 173, Cr. Likewise, the allegations of mala fides of the
informant are of secondary importance.
