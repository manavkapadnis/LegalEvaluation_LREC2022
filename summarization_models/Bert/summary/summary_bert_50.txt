Anand Ramachandra Chougule vs Sidarai Laxman Chougala on 6 August, 2019
Author: Navin Sinha
Bench: Navin Sinha, Hon'Ble Ms. Banerjee
REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(s). Relying on Raj Kumar vs. State of Maharashtra, (2009) 15 SCC 292, it has been submitted that if
the accused took a plea of self defence, burden was on them under Section 105 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 to demonstrate that their case would come under any of the general exceptions
under the IPC. If the First Information Report lodged by the accused with regard to the same incident was not
exhibited by the prosecution or evidence with regard to hospitalization and injury reports of the
accused were also not placed, relying on Dayal Singh and others vs. State of Uttaranchal, (2012) 8
SCC 263 and Gajoo vs. State of Uttarakhand , (2012) 9 SCC 532 it was submitted that at best it may
be a case of defective investigation which cannot dent the credibility of the prosecution case with
regard to the premediated murderous assault with a common intention. The burden lies on the prosecution to prove the allegations beyond all reasonable doubt. We find it difficult to concur with the submission on behalf of the appellants that the failure of
the prosecution to investigate the F.I.R. lodged by the accused with regard to the same occurrence or
to place their injury reports on record was merely a defective investigation. Gazoo (supra) is also distinguishable on its facts as it related only to failure in obtaining the
serologist report.
