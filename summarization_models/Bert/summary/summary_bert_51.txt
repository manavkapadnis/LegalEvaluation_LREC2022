examined one Chaudhari at whose house at Pimpri Nandu accused No.1 was allegedly sitting on the
date of trap i.e. 14.11.2006. Though statements of other persons from Pimpri Nandu were recorded
by the investigating officer they have not examined by the prosecution. L.J.(Cri.)551,

in the appeal against conviction of the appellant for the offence under Section 7 and
13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, it was held that grant of
sanction suffered from non-application of mind. Moreover, it shows that shining of
anthracene powder was found to the left hand pocket of paijama of accused No.2, to both the hands
and palms of the complainant. Similarly on the basis of evidence of the
complainant, PW-2 (Panch No.1) I hold that the prosecution has proved the second demand of bribe
amount of Rs.1,000/- made by the accused No.1 to the complainant on 14.11.2006 ( 78 )
criappeal483.09 final prior to the trap on that day.
