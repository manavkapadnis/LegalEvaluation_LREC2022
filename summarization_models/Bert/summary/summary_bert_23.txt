Smt. Ten/A. 112 of 1995 has been partly 208-WP.3843-1996.doc allowed by the Maharashtra Revenue
Tribunal. He submitted that, all the Authorities below did not take into
consideration the evidence on record in its proper perspective while rejecting the claim of the
petitioner pertaining to survey No.114/2. It is further held that, the High Court while exercising its powers under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India was not entitled to discuss the evidence and come to its own conclusion on
the evidence as to who was in possession of the land. That was a matter for Revenue Authorities. An error of law which is apparent on the face
of record can be corrected by a writ, but not an error 208-WP.3843-1996.doc of fact, however, grave
it may appear to be. Nor can it, in exercise of this power, act as a court of
appeal over the orders of the court or tribunal subordinate to it. That, the High Court can interfere in exercise of its power of
superintendence when there has been a 208-WP.3843-1996.doc patent perversity in the orders of
the tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of
justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted. In other words, the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly
exercised. 9] In the Order dated 31st July 1989 passed in Tenancy Case No.7 of 1986, the Additional
Tahasildar, Kudal has observed that, the original tenant was allowed to occupy the house and the
manger in the land bearing 208-WP.3843-1996.doc in Survey No.111 Hissa No.2 as a tenant under
the Transfer of Properties Act even after his surrender of tenancy right in favour of the respondent
No.3. The present petition is accordingly dismissed.
