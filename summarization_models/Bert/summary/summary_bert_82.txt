under challenge in the writ petition before the High
Court by which the Municipal Corporation, Indore has
cancelled the building permission granted earlier was
rejected. So far as order dated 4.6.2020 issued by
the Building Officer of Indore Municipal
Corporation is concerned, at this stage, no
interference is called for as the petitioner
has failed to deposit the penalty amount and
this fact was suppressed in the application
submitted for building permission. Now, we come to the submission of Shri Sibal with
regard to orders and notices issued by the Municipal
Corporation and other State Authorities subsequent to
filing of this appeal. The

appeal

is
