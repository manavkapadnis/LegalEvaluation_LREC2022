CORAM : PRASANNA B. VARALE
AND
ANIL S. KILOR, JJ. D.J. Chaure, Sub Divisional Ofcer, Jalgaon. The second part of the land is utilized as cremation ground. It is also
submitted before this Court that an impression was created as if these houses are being constructed
under the scheme of State Government known as "Gharkul Yojna". I have also gone through the various
land record available at the various ofces. I say and submit that, in the spot inspection it has been found that, there are 5 fully
constructed houses and 2 incomplete houses on the disputed land. There is no
residential use of 5 houses and other two non residential uses. The land is also having an illegal tin shed but it was
not traced out as who own or who has built it. 1447 it was shown to be reserved for
ßxqjpj.khlkBhÞ6. The copy of the spot inspection report is also annexed to the afdavit in reply. In the concluding
part of this list of persons 6 930-PIL-93-2017 signed by the Gram Sevak, Shahapur, it is stated that
fve houses are complete, one house is partially complete and one house is an encroachment. Thus,
the only inescapable conclusion which can be drawn from perusal of this material along with the
submission of Mr. Brahme, learned Counsel appearing for the Gram Panchayat, is whatever
construction raised in the land Gut No. The tin sheds erected on the
land are also illegal. as
the Gram Panchayat has not granted any permission either for construction of houses or for erection
of tin sheds. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83178504/
