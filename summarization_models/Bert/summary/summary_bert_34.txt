by contacting him outside the office and he was asked not to make any complaint to Anti Corruption
Bureau. Our attention is also invited to a document at Exhibit 'B' which shows that at 14.07.31 hours on
that day in the afternoon a phone call was made by the Applicant to that office. Applicant has placed on record as part of his amendment, a statement of Shrikrushna Mahadev
Kondurkar. He was then working with Anti Corruption Bureau at Mumbai. However, on next day, Dr.
Gupta did not turn up. Therein he has pointed
out the stand taken by the Applicant. This communication is replied to by the Commissioner of
Police, Central Region, Mumbai and that authority has mentioned that as statement of witnesses
supported the complaint of Respondent No.2, police officers were duty bound to take cognizance
and there was nothing wrong with it. The statements of stenographer recorded by police also
supports this contention. Her supplementary statement is
recorded on 29.06.2006. The matter presented by Applicant would have been
registered and had some case number and would have appeared on daily board. This
investigation would have falsified the defence. Sneha Chavan
