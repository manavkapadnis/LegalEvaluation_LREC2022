failed to appreciate the evidence and also given the finding that A1 demanded and accepted
http://www.judis.nic.in the money in the presence of P.W3 and P.W10, the Trap Laying Officer had
not recovered the money from A1. 33.On reading of the suggestion put before P.W2, P.W2 handed over the money to A2, for having
engaged A2 and A2 has taken the stand that A2 received the money only as professional fee and not
as bribe money. 34.The evidence of P.W3 clearly shows that A1 demanded money on 24.07.2006 and on 25.07.2006
A2 received the money from P.W2 only for A1 as bribe money and not professional fee and P.W2 has
not engaged A2 as his counsel at any point of time not only in the said theft case but also any other
cases. 5, 6 and 7 were also the suspected
persons, they are within the jurisdiction of A1 and that there is no documentary evidence to show
that P.W2 engaged A2 as his counsel not only in the said theft case and also any other cases, pending
before the police station, in which A1 was working. 38.The learned counsel for the accused would submit that no statement was recorded from the
accused soon after the completion of trap, the same is violated the Rule 47 of the Vigilance Manual.
