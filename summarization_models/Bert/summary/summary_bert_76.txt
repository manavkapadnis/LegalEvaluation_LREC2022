2002. She also raised the point that

was raised in the special leave petition filed by the Union
of India which is that Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case (supra)
is “per incuriam” inasmuch as it decided a point which arose
out

of

the

Amendment

Act

of

1984,

when

the

Section

4

notification was only of 1975, the 1984 Amendment Act not
being retrospective. He pointed out that the question of delay, though

raised by the learned counsel who appeared on behalf of the
State, was not directly answered in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s
case inasmuch as, according to the Division Bench of this
Court in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case, a mandatory condition
of a section 4 notification not being adhered to, would
amount to there being no acquisition at all in the eye of
law. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
