Kanwar Pal Singh vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 18 December, 2019
Author: S. Abdul Nazeer
Bench: S. Abdul Nazeer, Sanjiv Khanna

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.1920 OF 2019
ARISING OUT OF S.L.P.(CRIMINAL) NO. Referring to the
contents of the FIR, it is submitted that the appellant has been wrongly charge-sheeted by the police
for the offences, as at the best there was violation of Section 4, which is punishable under Section 21
of the Mines Regulation Act. In the written submissions filed by the appellant, a relatively new plea and
contention has been raised by relying upon the (2009) 7 SCC 526 judgments of this Court in
Belsund Sugar Company Limited v.
State of Bihar,2 Sharat Babu Digumarti v. Government of NCT of Delhi3 and Suresh Nanda v.
Central Bureau of Investigation 4 to urge that the Mines Regulation Act being a special statute,
prosecution for an offence under Section 379 of the IPC would not be maintainable. The contention relying on the same reasoning before us, therefore,
must be rejected. In
this context, it was observed that Section 22 of the TOHO Act prohibits taking of cognizance except
on a complaint made by an appropriate authority and therefore the police report filed by the CBI
was only a complaint petition made by an appropriate authority in terms of Section 22 of the TOHO
Act. ......................................J.
