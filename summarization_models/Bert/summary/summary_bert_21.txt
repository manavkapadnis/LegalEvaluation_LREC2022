the Petitioners. P. K. Lakhotia, AGP for Respondent State. 7 to 15), situated at village Kauthe
Malkapur, Taluka Sangamner, District Ahmednagar and it is Hadola Watan land. Though the matter
concerns with the permission to convert the suit property into non-agricultural use, certain facts, as
pleaded by both the parties, are required to be mentioned. 15, which is re- granted by the State Government. 15/9, 15/10 and 15/17 which is
disputed in the present writ petition. The petitioners have already filed Special Civil Suit No. Petitioners claim that their valuable rights are
included in the suit property and hence the petitioners have filed the above mentioned suit for
partition by metes and bounds. Both the
applications were heard on merits and the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Sangamner, by
order dated 24.04.2015 held that the Civil Court has jurisdiction to entertain the said suit so also the
issue of limitation is a mixed question of facts and hence the suit itself is maintainable. 56 of 2015 before this Court and after hearing both the sides this Court by order dated
27.07.2015 specifically held that the suit filed by the present petitioners along WP-8788-15pd with
others in the Civil Court is very well maintainable. It is the case of the petitioners that even prior to the re-grant of land gat no. However, the said mutation entries came to be rejected by the concerned Tahsildar on the ground
that the land itself was not re-granted. 928 and 929 came to be sanctioned by the Tahsildar on
11.02.1970. 456,
457 and 458 were fraudulently taken. Said Ravindra
Birole filed Writ Petition No.7513 of 2013 before this Court and this Court granted status quo in the
matter which continued from time to time. 15/10 ad- measuring 3 H.

land was excluded from development plan. Further, said WP-8788-15pd Ravindra Birole was
directed to submit the NOC of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. On
07.08.2013, for the first time, the NOC issued by the Pollution Control Board was produced on
record by Ravindra Birole. The present petitioners had filed an WP-8788-15pd application for
intervention in the said appeal and the Additional Commissioner, Nashik allowed the said
application. 2659 of 2014 before this Court challenging the
order dated 27.01.2014 instead of filing an appeal. 7513 of 2013 remained pending for many days. Even though the petitioners have specifically
requested for supply of copies of the documents, no documents, annexed to the revision application,
were supplied to the petitioners and they were directed to file reply within one week. The Hon'ble Minister by

impugned order dated 13.05.2015, has allowed the revision application filed by respondent no.6
herein, set aside the order dated 27.01.2014 passed by the Additional Commissioner and further
directed the Sub-Divisional Officer, Sangamner to grant NA permission for industrial use as per the
discussion made in the body of the order. The petitioners
were only supplied the copy of the revision application but the documents annexed to the revision
application were never supplied to the petitioners. Though it was specifically brought to the notice of
the Hon'ble Minister, yet the documents were not supplied. The Hon'ble Minister has decided the said revision on
merits without condoning the delay. Thus, the revision
before the Hon'ble Minister is premature and the same could not have been entertained. There is no provision in the
amended Act of 1958 to pay 13 times Najrana to convert new tenure land into old tenure land. All the sale deeds are the subject
matter of challenge in special civil suit no. There is no measurement map prepared by
issuing notice to all the land holders and adjacent land holders. 15 without making any actual measurement. Learned senior
counsel submits that there is no deemed NA permission and on a simple application without
compliance of any statutory rules, the permission for NA use cannot be granted. Rama Narayan Mali vs. Additional Collector, Thane & Ors., Chandrika Jha vs. State of Bihar and Others, reported in (1984) 2 SCC 41. 15/3 ad-measuring 11 H. 48
R.) situated at Kauthe Malkapur, Taluka Sangamner on 07.02.2013. He submits that since
respondent no.6 has not complied with the queries mentioned in letter dated 15.04.2013 issued by
respondent no.3/Sub-Divisional Officer in given time limit, the said application dated 07.02.2013
came to be rejected by order dated 07.05.2013. Being aggrieved, respondent
no.6 preferred Revision Application No. 932 of 2015 before respondent no.5/Hon'ble Minister. 49 of 2013 by the Divisional Commissioner, Nashik came to
be set aside. Learned AGP submits that so far as the procedure under Sections 44(1) and 44(2) of the MLR
Code is concerned, respondent no.3/Sub-Divisional Officer has issued a letter dated 15.04.2013 to
respondent no.6 and called for compliance of the total four queries. In compliance of the mandate of
the above said provisions of the MLR Code, the office of the Sub-Divisional Officer and the Tahsildar
had conducted a detailed enquiry in respect of the land under N.A. and the Tahsildar forwarded its
report to the Sub-Divisional Officer. Therefore, the
submission of respondent no.6 about deemed permission of N.A. carries no substance. The present
petitioners and others have filed Special Civil Suit No. 15/3 ad- measuring 11 H. 48 R.) purchased by
respondent no.6. 27 of 2013 and the present writ petition. However, due to oversight, the
date on the order was wrongly mentioned as 23.09.2015. The office record bears truthfulness of passing of the said order on 22.09.2015. Respondent No.6 is having land is 30 acres = (11.48 Hectors), bearing old Gat Nos. 6 from
Ramchandra Sagar (who had purchased it from Bagul in the year 1966) on 26.06.2012. 15 was a piece of land which fell under the category of re-granted land. The Government by General Order dated
12.11.1955 prescribed payment of ten times of the assessment for Transfer and 3 times for occupancy
rights. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that the issue involved in the present petition
relates to Section 44 of MLR Code i.e. conversion of land from agricultural purpose to
non-agricultural purpose i.e. industrial purpose. 928 and 929 of re-grant order are recorded. There was time
limit of 2 years to set up the sugar factory. It states that it could be challenged by
filing an appeal. The communication dated 15.04.2013 by itself does not set out any
time limit, nor it states about the consequence of non-compliance. As per the letter dated 13.06.2013, the report of the Circle Inspector was
produced, stating that there is no discrepancy or objection about the four boundaries. 27 of 2013 has already been instituted in the Civil Court to which Revenue authorities are
also parties. The SDO is not competent to hold a parallel trial. Corresponding mutations are carried out in the revenue record and it has reached finality. Thereafter, successive transfers are also effected. Now, after inordinate and unreasonable delay, the
transactions which were settled before 50 years are sought to be unsettled. The validity of the sale
deeds is sought to be questioned. Ex-facie, it is also hit by Article 59 of the Limitation Act, which
provides the Limitation of three years. Prior to filing of Special Civil Suit No. 1 and 2, is the subject matter of Special Civil Suit No. The land was already
converted to old tenure on making payment of 13 times the occupancy price, vide mutation entry
Nos. The Bombay Inferior Village Watans Abolition Act, 1958 is
accordingly amended. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that ground No.3 about the Ceiling Act is also bad
in law on account of inherent lack of jurisdiction. The grounds which are stated in the order are
irrelevant and not germane to the proceedings under Section 44 of the MLR Code. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that the ground No.4 is also non-est. The respondent had
always exhibited his readiness and willingness to deposit 50% Najrana. Still, the fault is being
attributed to him in this behalf. Rule No.9 of the
Maharashtra Land Revenue (Conversion of Use of Land and N.A. Assessment) Rules, 1969, deals
with regularization of unauthorized use. The boundaries of answering respondent are confirmed in measurement of shares
within boundaries and concerned Phalnibara extract is sanctioned by revenue authorities. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168431808/

22. Therefore, in absence of any challenge by the petitioners or
anyone to the said re-grant order, the same has attained finality. The sale
deeds in respect of the land were executed way back in the year 1966. The consideration in respect of
such transactions was paid and the purchasers were placed in possession of the properties. The
mutation entries in respect of the said WP-8788-15pd purchasers were also made thereafter. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that the application for conversion of the land to
non agriculture was moved before the S.D.O. on 07.02.2013. On 14.03.2013, the Town
Planning Department issued recommendation subject to compliance of certain conditions. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that respondent No.6 informed the Tahsildar in
writing on 20.08.2013 that it has started working on the land considering it as non agriculture land. In response to the said letter, the S.D.O. by its letter dated 23.08.2013 wrote to the Assistant
Director of Town Planning for reconsideration, and informed respondent No. 6 that the letter dated
20.08.2013 is being forwarded to the Assistant Director of Town Planning. 3 in its affidavit further fortifies this
fact. The
transactions in respect of the land of respondent No. The
said temporary injunction application was rejected by the learned Trial Court finding that there is
no prima facie case, there is a long silence and inaction on the part of the plaintiffs/petitioners and
the plaintiffs/petitioners are no way concerned with the property bearing Gat No. 6, as is apparent from the 7/12 extracts filed on record. 6-company, although the WP-8788-15pd application for
conversion was filed by the promoters-Mrs. An inquiry was conducted by the Assistant Director
of Town Planning and conditional recommendations were issued and said conditions were fulfilled
by respondent No. 2659 of 2014 before
this Honourable Court. This Court, by order dated 15.4.2015 disposed of writ petition No. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that in the above sequence of events and
considering the fact that under section 248 of the M.L.R. Code, appeal lies to the State Government
in respect of the original order passed by the Commissioner etc., It can also be gathered from the impugned order that each and every
argument of petitioners is reordered and considered. The certified copies applied by petitioners are
immediately received by them in a single day. Therefore,
in the light of the settled position of law, the present petition is not at all maintainable. and others, reported in (2009) 10 SCC 273. Santoshkumar Shivgonda Patil and Others vs. Balasaheb Tukaram Shevale and

parties. 15 is situated at Kauthe Malkapur, Taluka Sangamner, District
Ahmednagar and the land ad-measuring 30 Acres (11.48 Hec.) It is also not disputed that the land gat no. It is the contention of the petitioners that even though there was no re-grant orders, some of the
watandars had illegally sold the portion of land gat no. 7 to 15) and an attempt was
made to get the mutation entry nos. 850 to 851, respectively, certified from the Revenue authorities. However, the said mutation entries came to be rejected by the Tahsildar. 1911/1966 and some portion of survey no.9 under registered sale deed sr. The land was re-granted
on payment of Najrana on 10+3 times on 01.04.1965 and 20.07.1965 and accordingly, the mutation
entry nos. In terms of the said provisions of
Sub-section (3) which was already in existence, the occupancy of the land re-granted under
Sub-section (1) was not to be transferable or partiable by metes and bounds without previous
sanction of the Collector and except on payment of such amount as the State Government may by
general or special order determine. If he fails to do so, deeming clause comes into operation whereby the permission sought for is
deemed to have been granted. (2) Any person aggrieved by such decision may file an appeal to the State
Government within ninety days of such decision. 15/10, 15/9 and 15/17 admeasuring 11 Hec. 48 R.
situated at Kauthe Malkapur, Taluka Sangamner, District Ahmednagar. Further, the Sub-Divisional Officer has also directed Ravindra Birole to remove
the deficiencies as pointed by the Assistant Director, Town Planning, Ahmednagar. It appears that being aggrieved by the order passed by the Sub- Divisional
Officer, Sangamner dated 07.05.2013, the said Ravindra Birole has filed Writ Petition No. It further appears that
the learned Additional Divisional Commissioner, Nashik has considered the rival submissions of
both the parties and after hearing the arguments of Ravindra Birole and the third party, formulated
the points viz: (i) It was necessary to take a decision after verifying the N.A. proposal and
considering the restrictions imposed on Inam Class 6-B land, (ii) the objection as to whether the
watandar can sale WP-8788-15pd the watan land can be decided by filing separate appeal for
revision before the competent court. 1 to 4 as formulated in the said order
dated 27.01.2014. It further appears that the Hon'ble Minister has passed the impugned order
hastily. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn by the Hon'ble Minister in paragraph no. 30 of the
order are not proper, correct and legal. 15 and that earlier mutation entries came to be taken with regard to
the same and those mutation entries came to be cancelled subsequently. 15/9, 15/10 and 15/17 under

such an inquiry, undoubtedly, the authority has to get itself satisfied about the fact of ownership of
the land of the applicant. The
Additional Divisional Commissioner, Nashik has remanded the matter in a different context on the
different points. Gammon
India Ltd. and others vs. Union of India and others (supra), the ratio laid down therein cannot be
made applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. Thus the ratio laid down in the aforesaid case cannot be made applicable to
the facts and circumstances of the present case. In the instant case, however, there are disputed
facts and only one conclusion is not possible. Thus, with these observations, I proceed to pass the
following order. ORDER
