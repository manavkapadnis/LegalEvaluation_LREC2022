remote villages of the State. Per contra, the private players in
transport services are earning huge profit and day by day they are improving the number of omni
buses and services. Under these circumstances, any citizen can logically think about the reason for
which the Transport Corporations are sustaining heavy monetary loss. Of course, Government Corporations cannot be aimed for making profit. The first respondent is
directed to issue suitable orders for fixing CCTV Cameras in the Bus Stand, Transport
Corporation Depots, administrative offices as well as in the working places to
monitor the working pattern as well as to ascertain the illegalities and irregularities,
if any, committed in such places, for the purpose of improvising the efficiency level in
the administration.
