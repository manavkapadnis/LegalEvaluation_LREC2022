the conviction under Section 302 of the IPC to under

Part-II of the IPC. The appellant was given

to drink on the fateful night. According to the

prosecution case there was a quarrel. He relied on the

following judgments:

of Tamil Nadu

It was

noted further by the High court that when the evidence
of the PW2 and PW3 was put to him he agreed with the
statement that the deceased has committed suicide. The appellant and the deceased-wife

were living in a separate bed room. PW1,

in his chief examination deposed that the brother of
the appellant and two others informed that his sister
was hospitalised due to sore throat. Later he was

informed that she died due to hanging. At about

7.00 pm his wife came there in search of him and he
went with her. His version that he was heavily drunk

and it was his wife who fully supported him and he was
finding it difficult to walk under the influence of
alcohol. He admitted to having a separate bed room. An altercation between his mother and his wife is
noticed. His mother beat him and he sustained
He fell fast asleep. This version was noted

by the learned Principal Sessions Judge to be a new
version and not made at the time of the original
questioning under Section 313 Cr. PC or in the cross
examination of the prosecution witnesses. The dispute escalated and

a state of acrimony was attained. 13

In
that
case,
the
result
of
a
consideration of the decision of this
Court in relation to the provisions of
Section 105 of the Evidence Act was summed
up by me as follows (at pages 97-98):
“... an accused's plea of an exception may
reach one of three not sharply demarcated
stages, one succeeding the other, depending
upon the effect of the whole evidence in the
case judged by the standard of a prudent man
weighing
or
balancing
probabilities
carefully. But, when both sides have led
evidence of their respective versions,
the accused can show, from any evidence
on the record, whether tendered by the
prosecution or the defence, that the
mandatory presumption is removed. PW 1 and
PW 2 overheard the squeal of a pig. They
also overheard the sound of a quarrel. Respondent and the deceased had two children. convicted

the

We may notice

It reads as under:

“8. In certain cases the
accused would offer some explanations to
incriminative circumstances. In very rare
instances the accused may even admit or
own incriminating circumstances adduced
against him, perhaps for the purpose of
adopting legally recognised defences. In
all such cases the court gets the
advantage of knowing his version about
those aspects and it helps the court to
effectively appreciate and evaluate the
evidence in the case. The law is that burden of proving such
an exception is on the accused. There can be no doubt

that the burden to prove that the case is made out in
a particular case is on the prosecution unless the law
declares otherwise. It is equally true that even without adducing

any defence evidence it may be possible for the accused
to discharge the said burden with reference to material
appearing by virtue of the prosecution evidence which
includes

the

witnesses. The accused may also be entitled to

the benefit of reasonable doubt. It is true, no doubt, evidence was

tendered by PW2 and PW3, who it may be noted are the
brothers

of

the

appellant,

that

appellant committed suicide. in

the

statement

After the matter was remanded,
the

appellant

continued

to

persevere with the stand and set up the case that he
was beaten up by his mother following a quarrel between
her and his wife and then he fell fast asleep. There

is

aggressor. also

Till such time there

is no hint even of any sudden fight or sudden quarrel. A dimension however

about intoxication may be noted. Section 86 begins by

referring to an act which is not an offence unless done
with a particular knowledge or intent. Thereafter, the

law giver refers to a person committing the act in a
state of intoxication. What about

an act which becomes an offence if it is done with a
specific intention by a person who is under the state
of

intoxication? He asked a young boy to step aside a little
so that he could occupy a convenient
did not budge. It is no doubt true that while the
first part of the section speaks of intent
or knowledge, the latter part deals only
with knowledge and a certain element of
doubt in interpretation may possibly be
felt by reason of this omission. This is not the first time that the
question comes up for consideration. Was the man beside his mind
altogether for the time being? Of course, we have to distinguish
between motive, intention and knowledge. In order that an act is to be punished

as

must

murder,

it

be

declared to be murder. In cases where the accused is

able to establish he is entitled to the benefit of any
of the exceptions under Section 300 then his case may
be considered under Part-I or Part-II of Section 304
of the IPC depending on whether the act which caused
the culpable homicide was done with the intention of
causing death or with knowledge that it is likely to
cause death. However, if

the case falls under any of the four limbs of Section
300, there would be no occasion to allow Section 304
to have play. None of

the exceptions in Section 300 are attracted. The act

amounts to murder within the meaning of Section 300 of
the IPC. .......................J.
