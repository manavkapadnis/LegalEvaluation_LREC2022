Municipal Corporation for the construction of a road in the Sinthee area. According to the writ petitioners, no previous notice for acquisition was issued to
the owners of the land by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the land was
acquired in or about the year 1996-97. 3

A second writ petition, WP No.11300(W) of 2003, followed. petition was disposed of by an order dated April 1, 2005. There also appears to be a serious dispute on the quantum of land actually acquired
for such public purpose and therefore, this Court feels it necessary that a joint
inspection should be held by the Senior Officers of the Corporation and the
representative of the Petitioner to find out the extent of land acquired for widening
the road. The aforesaid inspection should be done within 8(eight) weeks from the date of the
communication of this order. Both the writ petitioners and the Corporation are in appeal. The Corporation has referred to Sections 352 and 363 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act,
1980 to submit that the Corporation is authorised to acquire land and the quantum of compensation
payable by the Corporation is provided for in Section 363 of the said Act. On the other hand, the
case run by the writ petitioners is that since no notice of any kind was issued prior to the petitioners'
land being taken, the petitioners are entitled to complete restitution or payment at a fair rate. Though there is a system of calculation which has been indicated, yet no
mechanism indicated as to how to resolve an issue when the land-loser is dissatisfied with the
quantum of compensation. Further, the quantum of compensation indicated in Section 363 of the
Act may not be acceptable and Section 363 of the Act of 1980 may even be ultra vires the
Constitution. The
issue here is what would be the fair compensation due to the petitioners upon the petitioners
graciously accepting that their land has been acquired. In such a scenario, particularly, when at the
relevant time, there was the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 which guided as to how compensation
would be decided, it is difficult to accept that the Act of 1980 in this State would provide for a
different methodology for assessment or payment of lesser compensation than would be payable in
respect of acquisition of land under the Act of 1894. The LA Collector's report in terms of this order should be available by February 15, 2020.
