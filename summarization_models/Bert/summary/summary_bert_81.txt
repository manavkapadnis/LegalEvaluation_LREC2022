1. Both these civil appeals arise out of a common

judgment dated 19.07.2017, passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Bombay, in writ petition Nos. Petitioner

Wireless Road, JVPD Scheme, Juhu, whereas the subject
matter of the 2017 writ petition, is a plot of land admeasuring

refer to the parties, as arrayed in writ petition No. The said Scheme was called as JVPD Scheme. and

said writ petition, there was a settlement between the
parties and both the petitions came to be disposed of,
in accordance with the consent terms, by order dated
10.11.2014. The Chief Officer, MHB, vide Order dated 24.07.2013,
rejected the claim of Anjuman Trust. Primarily, it was the case of the writ petitioners

before the High Court that, as these two plots were
shown as open spaces/garden in the sanctioned layout,
in the year 1967, as such, they cannot be used for

constructions. 14 and 11 in these plots, which were
shown earlier as reserved for open spaces/garden, can
very well be used for making constructions. The

relief

sought

in

the

writ

petition

was

opposed by the State Government as well as MHADA, on
the ground that as the said sub-divisioned plots were
shown as residential, in the development plan of 1999,
there

is

no

impediment

for

these two plots. Consequently, the lease deed executed

per cent of the entire holding area shall

shall be as far as practicable in one
place. As rightly held by the High Court, we are also of
the view that the two plots, which are shown as open

purpose of allotting small plots to the members of
Dawoodi Bohra Community. It is not in dispute, such layout is
approved and all the plots, except these two plots,
which are left towards open space/garden were utilized
for

construction. yards,

indicates broadly the usages in different zones. It is fairly well settled
that the open spaces/garden left in an approved layout,
cannot be allowed for the purpose of constructions. It is not necessary for only the owner
to apply for such layout. The Chief Officer, in
his communication, has made it clear that the mandatory
open spaces in the approved plan are to be leased out
to

neighbouring

purposes. It is not open to claim for construction in the
two plots which are reserved for open spaces/garden

also. ……………………………………………………………………J
