N. Ramamurthy vs State By Central Bureau Of ... on 26 April, 2019
Author: D Maheshwari
Bench: M 1 Dinesh, A M Sapre
REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 751-752 OF 2019
(Arising out of SLP(Crl.) 1 of 2018 and 1 of 2019 in
Criminal Appeal No. The appellant herein was tried as Accused No. 23,53,090/- in various accounts maintained by the customers
in the bank like Savings Bank Account, Current Account, Term Deposit, Reinvestment Deposit etc;
and the amount so debited was fraudulently credited to the personal accounts of the appellant and
was obtained by forging the withdrawals. 9,46,399/-; and subsequently, the appellant made withdrawals on different
dates from the said account by forging the signatures of K. Prabhakara. Suffice would be to notice for the present purpose that during the trial,
Accused No. 1 expired and the matter stood abated qua him. 12 of 2002, the Court of XLVI Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge and Special Judge for
C.B.I. Cases, by its judgment dated 22.10. 50,000/-, in default to pay the fine
amount, shall further undergo simple imprisonment for one year. 2 for the offence under Section 420 IPC shall undergo rigorous
imprisonment of seven years and pay fine of Rs. 270-272 of the SLP paper-book fine of Rs. All the sentences shall run concurrently. 2000 of 2018, before the High Court of
Karnataka at Bengaluru. 12/2002, wherein the present appellant/accused No. 2
has been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 120-B r/w Sections 420,
409, 468, 471, 477-A of IPC and under Section 13(2) r/w Sections 13(1)(c) and (d) of
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and sentenced accordingly. 2 is said to be 66 years, as such, many age related
ailments are natural to be present in many of the people. It is incorrect to say that because a person
is serving sentence, he is deprived of the proper medical care. As such, the health related grounds
canvassed also is not acceptable. In the case on hand, for the reasons given above, I do not find that it is one such case, which
deserves the suspension of sentence and enlargement of the accused on bail." Thereafter, the second application seeking suspension of
execution of sentence was moved on behalf of the appellant, being IA No. 1 of 2019, on the ground of
his deteriorating health condition. He was
sentenced accordingly by the Special Court. The Special Court has ordered separate
sentence of imprisonment and fine for each of the offences for which the appellant
was found guilty. The sentence of imprisonment all put together comes to 45 years of
rigorous imprisonment (for all the proven guilt put together)." No great deal of discussion is required to say that

such an assumption by the High Court had been fundamentally incorrect and the High Court,
obviously, omitted to notice that the Trial Court had specifically ordered that all the sentences shall
run concurrently. Secondly, the High Court has proceeded to refer to the principles governing the
consideration of the prayer for suspension of the operation of the order of conviction, although the
prayer in the present matter had only been for suspension of execution of sentence. In both the orders impugned, the High Court, apart from the aforesaid error about the length of
imprisonment to be served by the appellant, has also proceeded on entirely irrelevant consideration
with reference to the principles related with the prayer for suspension of the operation of the order
of conviction that such a suspension could be granted only in rare and exceptional cases and for
special reason. This Court pointed out the subtle distinction in the proposition for
suspension of an order of conviction on one hand and that for suspension of sentence on the other. This Court explained and laid down as under:
11. 2000 of 2018 by the High Court of Karnataka
are set aside; and the said IA Nos. 1 of 2018 and 1 of 2019 are restored for consideration afresh. .............................................J. (ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE) ............................................J. (DINESH
