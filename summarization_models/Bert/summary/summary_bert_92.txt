REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 3008-3015 OF 2020)
STATE OF KERALA & ANR. However, after
one year of this Flyover being used, the Consultancy Agency for the
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India, on
regular inspection of the bridge, reported on 16.03.2018 that the
bridge was in a distressed condition with several cracks as a result
of which measures should be taken to rehabilitate the flyover. Dr. E.
Sreedharan, by a report dated 14.09.2019, referred to the IIT
reports and did not agree with the same, stating that if his plan was
to be carried out, a 100 year guarantee would be given for the
newly constructed flyover. Sri Ashok Kumar M. (Convenor)

3. However, a load test as
specified in IRC 112:2011 has not been proposed by
IIT Chennai. But, IIT has not mentioned the service life of the
flyover after strengthening. The required completion
time for both cases is almost the same. RBDCK will hand
over the bridge site to DMRC free of all encumbrances. RBDCK shall realize the loss sustained to the
Government from the contractor in the light of the
report of IIT Madras, report of Dr. E.Sreedharan and
the FIR filed in case No. The Government and its
authorities are not in favour of a load test since they
feel that the aforesaid cracks itself are enough to
arrive at a conclusion that those girders are to be
demolished. (iii) The entire process shall be completed within a
period of three months or at an early date, as may be
possible. 10) The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms. ……………….......................... J.
