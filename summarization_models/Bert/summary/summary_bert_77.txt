INHERENT JURISDICTION
REVIEW PETITION (C) D. No. ENVIRONMENT & FOREST DEPARTMENT

…….Respondent(s)

ORDER

Delay Condoned. Having examined the matter in its totality, this Court found that after

issuance of the notification dated 06.03.1976 and inclusion of the subject land
therein, there was no occasion for the appellant acquiring any further right in
the land after expiry of the term of lease on 30.06.1977 and hence, the alleged
second lease for a period of 25 years was of no effect; and the appellant had
no right to claim damages from the State. Having examined the record and the grounds stated, we are unable to

find any error apparent on the face of the record calling for review of the
judgment dated 20.08.2019.
