2018 upon calling the cleaner Rajnikant Mane complainant came to
know that the vehicle was loaded with sugar bags weighing around
25 tons and the consignment was scheduled to be transported to
Kerala. On 17 th October,
2018 complainant received call from Amboli Police Station informing
him that the truck bearing No. KA 22 B-8526 is found with a dead
body in it and sugar bags were missing. It is alleged that
sugar was sold to the applicant and the same was being kept in his
godown through accused No.8. He is not involved in committing robbery and murder. At the most the applicant
can be protected as received of stolen property. Learned APP submitted that prior to the incident, during

incident and after offence there were calls between applicant and
prime-accused. C.C.T.V. footage shows that the stolen sugar is
unloaded in the premises of applicant. Assuming there are calls

between accused no inference can be drawn that applicant had
conspired to commit robbery and murder. Investigation is
completed and charge-sheet is filed. v) Bail Application stands disposed of accordingly.
