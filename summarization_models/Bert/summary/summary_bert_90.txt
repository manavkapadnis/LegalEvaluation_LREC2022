Magistrate with a delay of 11 days. The delay in sending the special report was also
the subject of discussion in a recent decision
being Sheo Shankar Singh v. State of U.P. [Sheo
Shankar Singh v. State of U.P., (2013) 12 SCC 539 :
(2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 390] wherein it was held that before
such a contention is countenanced, the accused must
show prejudice having been caused by the delayed
dispatch of the FIR to the Magistrate. In this context, we would like to refer to a recent
decision of this Court in Sandeep v. State of
U.P. [Sandeep v. State of U.P., (2012) 6 SCC 107 :
(2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 18] wherein the said position has
been explained as under in paras 62-63: (SCC p. 132)
“62. It was also feebly contended on behalf of the
appellants that the express report was not forwarded to
the Magistrate as stipulated under Section 157 CrPC
instantaneously. It would depend on the facts and
circumstances of the case. [ The obligation is on the IO to communicate the
report to the Magistrate. 982 of 2011

FIR to the Magistrate, the Court would not conclude that
the FIR has been registered much later in time than
shown. Albeit,
this fact has to be considered when we examine the credibility of
the version of the eye-witnesses; in this case, the testimonies of
Dinesh Singh (PW-1) and Mukesh Singh (PW-2). While examining this contention, it may be pertinent to note that
Dr. Balbeer Singh (PW-3) in his testimony had referred to the Post
Mortem Report (Ex-A/2) and had stated that the post mortem was
conducted on 15.07.1999, at about 03:00 p.m. Dr. Balbeer Singh
(PW-3) had also referred to several papers that were sent to him
including the panchayatnama. It

eloquently describes the manner in which the murder was
committed. to the direction
from where they came from. Moreover, a witness would not be aware about the difference
between an officer of field unit and officers attached to the Police
Station. 982 of 2011
