REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 2.1

It is submitted by the learned Advocate that as such there

was a huge delay of five and a half years and therefore as such
the same was not required to be condoned by the High Court. It
is submitted that in any case the High Court is not justified in
granting the statutory benefits and the interest on the enhanced
amount of compensation for the period of delay. It is submitted that the order condoning the

delay had attained finality and therefore subsequently it is not
open for the appellant to submit that the High Court ought not to
have awarded the statutory benefits and the interest for the
delayed period. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties

at length. ………………………………J.
