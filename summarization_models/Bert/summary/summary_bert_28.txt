Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr. Respondents-plaintiffs alleged that pursuant to the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate,
Hanuman Din forcibly took possession of land in khasra No.41 and therefore, the respondents filed
suit for declaration and permanent injunction. The appellants had been in continuous possession of the suit properties and the
same is reflected in the khataunis and other revenue records. D-20) was issued by the then iIlaqedar to Gaya Din and that the said document
being more than thirty years old is a genuine one. The first Appellate Court further held that the lease Ex. The first Appellate Court held that merely because of production of patta- lease
Ex. D-20 by Hanuman Din, it cannot be said to have been proved and therefore, it cannot be held
that Hanuman Din has a legal right of ownership on the disputed lands. 41, 131, 162 and 163 from the
father of the appellants. In the second appeal, the High Court affirmed the findings of the first Appellate Court and held
that the suit lands were recorded in the name of fathers of the respondents and that there was no
document on record to show that they have abandoned the possession of the lands or surrendered
the same in favour of iIlaqedar. Being aggrieved, the appellants have preferred this appeal. D-20) in 1929 in favour
of the appellants-defendants was illegal and that the appellants-defendants cannot claim right based
upon Ex. Vide Mahesh

11. The then illaqedar accepted the bid of the defendants father
Gaya Din in the auction held in the year 1929-Samvat 1986. The suit of the respondents-plaintiffs is for declaration of their title to the suit lands and
consequential delivery of the suit lands. But the
plaintiffs have not produced the patta granted to their fathers. In his evidence, PW-1 has stated that patta-lease was issued in the name of his father. The trial court as well as the first appellate court held
that the lease was granted in favour of father of respondents-plaintiffs at time of the settlement and
they were held to be original lessees. Drawing our attention to the findings of the trial court that patta was
granted in favour of the father of the respondents-plaintiffs, the learned senior counsel for the
respondents-plaintiffs submitted that this amounts to admission and in terms of Section 58 of the
Evidence Act, admitted facts need not be proved. vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019

facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission. When the respondents-plaintiffs
have filed the suit for declaration of their title, the respondents-plaintiffs cannot isolate few
sentences in the written statement and take advantage of only those part of the written statement
which are favourable to them. In the light of the evidence adduced, the trial court
rightly accepted the case of the defendants that in Samvat 1986 (1929 A.D.), in the auction held by
Pawaidar for lease of suit lands and other lands, bid of Gaya Din was accepted and the suit
properties along with other lands were given on lease to Gaya Din. The
appellants-defendants produced their patta-Ex. D-20 which has also been produced by the
respondents-plaintiffs (Ex. D-20, it is seen that as per Tahsildar order No.146/1960 dated
21.11.1960, Pawaidar has been allowed to enter in government serial. The said documents issued by the Tahsildar were produced from the custody of the appellants. The contents thereon show that as per the Government records, the lands had been given to Gaya
Din. It was then up to the respondents to rebut the presumption. Section 90 lays down that the court may
presume that the document is genuine. The respondents-plaintiffs have produced the copies of khasras of several years. However, only
the copies of khasra for the years 1955-56 (Ex. P-8) and
subsequent khasras for 1960-61 (Ex. The
lease was granted in favour of Gaya Din and that he and Hanuman Din had been continuously in
possession of the properties is thus established by the revenue records. From perusal of the Khatauni for the year 1952-53 (Ex. P-2) produced by the plaintiffs, it is seen
that the appellants- defendants are in possession of the suit lands from the year 1950-51 to 1954-55
(Ex. P-8) and thereafter, the subsequent khasras 1960-61 onwards. The names of the appellantsdefendants being mentioned in the khasra 1950-51 to 1954-55 is very crucial. The reason being
Vindhya Pradesh Abolition of Jagirs and Land Reforms Act, 1952 (Vindhya Pradesh Act) came into
force on 30.07.1953. D-20) was issued under Section 141 of the Act. It was therefore rightly held by the trial court that the
lease (Ex. D-20) is valid and that the appellants- defendants have proved that the lease of the lands
was legally given by illaqedar in favour of their father. D-20) was granted to them and that they are in possession of the suit
properties for several years. In the plaint, the respondents/plaintiffs have alleged that Ex. The respondents-plaintiffs have not produced any
document to prove that Ex. It is pertinent to note that Vishwanath
had given an application for inspection of the area (patta) in respect of land numbers 41, 131, 162,
163 and 164 situated in Village Bairath. P-3-Report of Revenue Inspector
states that the patta-Ex. Moreover, in the light of the findings by the revenue authorities on several occasions, the said
entries in the name of the respondents cannot be said to be genuine. Rewa, M.P.

. The application was sent to SDO for enquiry. The charge of interpolation is amply proved. So far as the present proceedings u/s 50 of the M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1959 are
concerned, they do not lie. Administratively, I uphold the order dated 28.07.1971 passed by the Tehsildar, because it is based
on unassailable logic. D-1-order of the Commissioner in its proper perspective. Application filed for receiving additional evidence:- The question may arise that though the
number of orders were passed in various proceedings before the Revenue Authorities, why the
respondents-plaintiffs have not challenged the same then and there. Unfortunately, those documents have not been filed by the
appellants-defendants in the courts below. 28.07.1971 Order of Tahsildar, Gopad

The learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that there is a clear bar to adduce
additional evidence in the appellate court subject to circumstances stated under Order XLI Rule 27
CPC and no such circumstance has been set-forth in the application filed by the appellants. It was further submitted that when these documents were neither
filed in the trial court nor before the first appellate court nor before the High Court, the Supreme
Court cannot entertain the documents filed as additional evidence. However, in the interest of justice
and when satisfactory reasons are given, court can receive additional documents. Thus, the
provision does not apply, when on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate
court can pronounce a satisfactory judgment. Such a discretion is only a judicial
discretion circumscribed by the limitation specified in the Rule itself. ( Vide K.
Venkataramiah v. A. Seetharama Reddy AIR 1963 SC 1526, Municipal Corpn. The appellate court should not ordinarily allow new evidence to be adduced in order to enable a
party to raise a new point in appeal. The mere fact that certain evidence is important, is not in itself a sufficient ground for admitting
that evidence in appeal. The order of the Commissioner dated 17.07.1973 refers to the order of the Tahsildar dated
28.07.1971 and also the report of the SDO dated 21.10.1969. Based upon such enquiry and report of the SDO dated 21.10.1969, the
Tahsildar held that the entry in regard to possession of the non-applicants (Vishwanath, Shiv Nath,
Jairaj Kumari) in respect of land numbers 41, 131, 162, 163 was found to be made subsequently and
held as under:-

Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr. I have
personally perused the Khasra for the years 1963-64 to 1967-68 and I find that apart
from the entries made in the column No.12 of the Khasra pertaining to the land No.41
at the time of inquiry, Vishwanath, Shivnath Kurmi, R/o Deh 41/1.39 it specifically
appears to be made subsequently.... Thus, it is proved that the entry in regard to the
possession of non applicants Vishwanath, Shivnath and Jairaj Kumri in respect of
land No.41, 151, 162 and 163 is found proved to be made subsequently. Now, it is
to be seen that who was in the possession of the disputed land prior to the disputed
years. In this regard, none of the parties has produced any evidence. In such circumstances, it is clear that Patwari
Halqa with the intention to create dispute in respect of the disputed land has
committed forgery before his retirement. D-1), in our view, it will not have the effect of introducing new case necessitating remittance of
the matter. vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019

the Courts below and now only produced as additional evidence. As discussed earlier, we are not
inclined to receive this document as additional evidence. Case of the respondents-plaintiffs is that as per Section 5 of the Vindhya Pradesh Abolition of
Jagirs and Land Reforms Act, 1952, all the Jagir Lands were resumed by the then Vindhya Pradesh
Government on 23.06.1953. On that date, illaqedar was not authorised and was not having
jurisdiction to issue patta. In 1935, Maharaja of Rewa promulgated the Rewa Land Revenue and
Tenancy Act, 1935. Thus, the action taken thereunder the said Act like grant of patta etc. In
1952, the State of Vindhya Pradesh abolished the system of Jagirdari by the Vindhya Pradesh
Abolition of Jagirs and Land Reforms Act, 1952. vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019

DW-1 must have been born in 1919. In this regard,
the learned senior counsel for the respondents-plaintiffs submitted that as per Section 5 of the
Vindhya Pradesh Act, all the Jagir Lands were resumed in the then Vindhya Pradesh Government
on 23.06.1953, hence, on this date, Pawaidar/iIlaqedar/Jagirdar were not authorised and were not
having jurisdiction to issue patta and therefore, the finding of the first appellate court that the patta
issued in the name of Gaya Din in the year 1954 is not a valid one and the said findings of fact
cannot be interfered with. Certain occupants of lands to be pattedar tenants. ( The first

Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr. The first Appellate Court and the High
Court erred in brushing aside the findings recorded by the Commissioner dated 17.07.1973 as to the
misconduct of the patwari in making entries in the revenue records. As noted above, the revenue entries relied on by them are also
held to be not genuine. They cannot confer any right or title on the party relying on
them for proving their title. Upon appreciation of evidence, the trial court has recorded findings on various issues which was
reversed by the first Appellate Court. The first
Appellate Court and the High Court did not consider Ex. D-20) and since
then, Gaya Din and Hanuman Din were in possession of the properties. ......J.
