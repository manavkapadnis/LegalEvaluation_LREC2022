99,"In her cross-examination, PW 2 admitted that she did not tell the police that her mother had asked her not to disclose the facts.",0

139,He was a witness to the inquest.,0
140,PW 14 was tendered in evidence.,0
141,PW 15 was an Investigating Officer of the case.,1

143,"He held the inquest, found a gunshot injury on the left rib of the victim and seized the wearing apparels as also some other articles including a hurricane and a lamp.",0
144,He examined witnesses and then arrested the accused Jatindra.,0
145,"In his cross-examination, PW 15 admitted that there was no note in the case diary as regards the assembly of the villagers.",1
146,He did not find any label on the hurricane and the lamp.,0
147,"PW 16, a Sub Inspector of the CID, was the second Investigating Officer.",0
148,He examined the informant and held raids for rest of the accused.,0
149,He arrested the accused Mohan on 23.10.1987 and the accused Karna and Prafulla on 26.10.1988.,0
150,He submitted a charge-sheet on 02.11.1988.,0
151,"In his cross-examination, he admitted that the names of some miscreants transpired after recording the statements of PWs 1, 2 and 12.",0
152,He stated that PW 12 did not tell him about the use of any rope.,2
153,He further stated that during his investigation the names of the accused transpired for the first time.,2
154,"PW 17 was the younger brother Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192650392/ 4 Jatindra Nath Mahato & Ors vs The State Of West Bengal & Anr on 14 February, 2019 of the victim and a post-occurrence witness.",7
155,He heard the sound of firing.,0
156,"He lodged a GD Entry over the said incident, which was recorded earlier.",0
157,PW 18 was the Learned Judicial Magistrate who conducted the test identification parade for the accused Mohanlal.,0
158,The witnesses PW 2 and PW 12 identified the victim before him.,0
159,The case of the accused in their examination under Section 313 of the Code was primarily a simple denial of the prosecution case.,5
160,6\.,0
161,"Mr. Ranadeb Sengupta, the Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants vehemently opposed the judgment and order of conviction and sentence.",0
162,"He submitted that before lodging of the First Information Report, a prior information was given and a GD Entry was recorded on that at the instance of PW 17.",0
163,"Therefore, the First Information Report is hit by Section 162 of the Code.",2
164,He submitted that it is strange that the police station number was incorporated in the inquest report although the First Information Report was allegedly registered later.,0
165,"He contended that the strangest part is that although the miscreants were alleged to be unknown as per the First Information Report, the description of some of them were given there and the informant stated that she would be able to identify the accused, yet subsequently the accused were found to be the relations of the informant, as per the informant herself.",3
166,"Although there was no description of any lame man as an accused in the First Information Report, PW 1 admitted in her evidence that one of the accused namely Kanistha was a lame man.",0
167,"PW 16, the second Investigating Officer claimed that the names of the miscreants came only after he had taken up investigation i.e., after quite a few days from the lodging of the First Information Report.",0
168,"According to the Learned Advocate, the delayed disclosure of the names of the accused creates a suspicion of false implication.",0
169,"He submitted that, although alluded to, no details of the marriage proposal, groom, threats, etc.",0
170,were forthcoming.,0
171,He submitted that the charges were defective in as much as the time of occurrence was not mentioned in the charge.,0
172,He contended that there were contradictions between the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 as regards how the dacoits entered the house.,1
173,He expressed his surprise about why Mohan Mahato who was known to the witnesses was sent for a T.I.,0
174,parade.,0
175,The Learned Advocate submitted that it was indeed a very unnatural conduct on the part of the victim's wife PW 5 to have asked her daughters not disclose the facts to others.,1
176,He submitted that PW 12 gave another version that the accused Mohan Mahato tied a rope on the victim.,0
177,The Investigating Officer too contradicted PW 12 on this.,0
178,"According to the Learned Advocate, PW 12 thus cannot be trusted.",0
179,"Besides, several witnesses had turned hostile.",0
180,"According to the Learned Advocate, PWs 5 and 13 only gave out hearsay accounts.",0
181,He submits that it is indeed very astonishing that no names of the accused were disclosed to the Investigating Officer/PW 15.,0
182,"Even as per PW 16, the second Investigating Officer, PW 1 mentioned the name of only one miscreant.",0
183,"This implies that the names of the other accused transpired after 24.11.1987 i.e., nearly two months after the incident.",0
184,The Learned Advocate submitted that the examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Code was not proper as the questions put were very complex.,4
185,"The Learned Advocate relied on Meharaj Singh's Case, 1994 SCC (Cri) 1390 on the question of ante timed First Information Report, on the State of Orissa Brahmananda Nanda, AIR 1976 SC 2488 on the delayed disclosure of the names of an accused by an eye- witness and on Naval Kishore Singh vs. State of Bihar, 2004 SCC (Cri) 1967 on the issue of putting rolled up questions under Section 313 of the Code.",16
186,7\.,0
187,Mr. N.P.,0
188,"Agarwala, the Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the State strongly supported the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellants.",1
189,"He submitted that PW 1 was a vital witness - the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192650392/ 5 Jatindra Nath Mahato & Ors vs The State Of West Bengal & Anr on 14 February, 2019 de facto complainant of the case and an eye-witness.",8
190,Her evidence was substantially corroborated by the two other vital eye-witnesses PWs 2 and 12.,0
191,He submitted that the inquest report corroborated the post-mortem report as regards the gunshot injury.,0
192,Rigor mortis was present.,0
193,"Therefore, the timing matched.",0
194,"PW 6, an independent witness, had seen the accused Mohanlal sometime before the incident.",0
195,PW 8 supported the presence of the victim in the village.,0
196,"The Learned Advocate submitted that the prior GD Entry did not give the details of the incident and hence, was not treated as a First Information Report.",0
197,He further submitted that there is no evidence as to when the inquest ended.,0
198,The FIR was received on that night only.,0
199,"The non- disclosure of names by the eye-witnesses was due to fear and the daughters clearly deposed that their mother PW 5 had asked them not to disclose the facts, or else she would be killed.",0
200,"As to the apparent contradiction between the evidence of PWs 1 and 12 regarding how the dacoits entered the house, PW 1 and 2 might not have been there in the same place at the same point of time.",0
201,The date and time of marriage proposal may very well not to be remembered by PW 1.,1
202,"The Learned Advocate also submitted that if the accused thought that the examination under Section 313 was not proper, they could have adduced defence witnesses.",3
203,8\.,0
204,We heard the submissions of the Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants as well as the State and carefully went through the evidence and other materials on record and the impugned judgment and order of conviction.,1
205,9\.,0
206,It appears that the motive to commit the offence has played a very important role in this case.,1
207,"Although purportedly out of fear, PW 1, the de facto complainant of the case and an eye-witness to the occurrence, earlier failed to specifically name the accused who were known to her, she nevertheless could master the courage to allude to certain earlier events that gave a clear inkling about the motive to murder.",1
208,"In the First Information Report as well as in her evidence, PW 1 clearly stated that one of the accused who accosted the victim at the time of commission of the offences, told the victim that the victim was too proud and would get her daughter married in 'unchu piri' and would give a motor cycle (to the groom).",3
209,The accused threatened that they would also murder the victim's wife and his special friend Nagu Babu of Baghmundi.,0
210,They also said that the victim was making her daughter study at Ayodhya More and just completed the study of his son from Orissa.,0
211,The reference of such utterances by the accused during the dacoity could be traced back to the earlier events as mentioned by PW 1.,0
212,PW 1 alleged that during the last few months the son-in- law of the appellant Kanistha brought a boy for giving her in marriage with him.,1
213,At that time the victim had derided that they would not get her daughter married to anybody.,0
214,The victim also said that he had given education to his daughter and would even given a motor cycle to his would be son-in-law.,0
215,"PW 1 further alleged that 2/3 days before Durga Puja, the wife of the appellant Kanistha had fever and the appellant Jatindra Mahato came and said that their mother was a witch and she should be killed.",1
216,"The other eye-witnesses and siblings of PW 1 namely PWs 2, 12 and 13 as also their mother PW 5 substantially corroborated PW 1's account of the prior incidents regarding refusal of marriage proposal and threats by the appellant Jatindra.",1
217,These prior facts make out a clear motive atleast for some of the appellants to conjure up a devious method to wreck vengeance upon the victim.,0
218,10\.,0
219,"As regards the issue of lodging of a prior GD Entry at the instance of PW 17, it is apparent that the same was not detailed and cogent enough to be treated as First Information Report.",0
220,"Therefore, a subsequent detailed information was treated as the First Information Report in this case.",1
221,"Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192650392/ 6 Jatindra Nath Mahato & Ors vs The State Of West Bengal & Anr on 14 February, 2019 11\.",7
222,"The delayed disclosure of the names of the accused, although known to the de facto complainant and other eye-witnesses, was due to the fear in their minds and in the minds of the other family members who were victims of the depredations caused by the appellants.",0
223,"It is quite clear from the evidence of the eye-witnesses namely, PWs 1, 2 and 12 that the appellants also wanted to finish off PW 5, their mother.",0
224,But they could not do so as she was not found at that place.,0
225,There is also evidence about prior threats given by the appellant Jatindra for murdering PW 5.,1
226,"In such circumstances, it is not at all unnatural for PW 5 to have requested her daughters, the eye-witnesses not to disclose the names of the miscreants and for the said young girls from the keeping her request and from out of fear not disclosing the names of the accused for sometime.",0
227,"The fear of a subsequent harm was so ominous that, as per PW 1, the police had to guard their home till the 'shradh' ceremony of the victim/deceased was over.",0
228,"The non- mentioning of the presence of a lame man amongst the accused, as the appellant Kanistha was indeed a lame man, too might have been out of the same fear that doing the same would specifically identify the said accused, which was not what PW 1 intended at that point out of fear.",1
229,"It appears that PW 15, the Investigating Officer in fact arrested one of the appellants namely the appellant Jatindra Nath on the very night of occurrence on the basis of suspicion as indicated in the First Information Report.",5
230,But the names of the accused were mentioned later on before the second Investigating Officer PW 16.,0
231,"Therefore, we do not find that the non- mentioning of the names of the miscreants in the First Information Report or immediately after the incident was fatal to the prosecution case.",1
232,12\.,0
233,"Moreover, there was no cross- examination of the Investigating Officer PW 16 over which specific names of the accused were disclosed to him before 24.11.1987.",0
234,"In any event, raids were conducted to nab the other accused even before 24.11.1987.",0
235,So some names were surely there before the Investigating Officer before 24.11.1987.,0
236,13\.,0
237,"We do not agree with the submission of the Learned Advocate for the appellants that any further details of the marriage proposal, groom's name and details of threats ought to have been given by the concerned witnesses.",0
238,Sufficient details were already given.,0
239,No man of ordinary intelligence and memory is supposed to remember any further details of these events even if the same were made known to him.,0
240,14\.,0
241,"As regards the apparent contradiction between PWs 1 and 2 regarding how the dacoits entered the house, it is quite possible that PW 2 was a witness to the events from before PW 1.",0
242,"Therefore, it is quite probable that PW 2 was a witness to certain initial acts.",0
243,15\.,0
244,It is true that PW 12 added a new facet to the sequence of events.,0
245,Unlike others she additionally deposed that the appellant Mohan Mahato tied a rope on the victim.,1
246,The Learned Advocate for the appellants contended that PW 2 stated this for the first time in Court in 1995 although the incident had taken place in 1987.,6
247,But it appears from the records that the story of tying of the victim with a rope found a mention by PW 12 during the test identification parade of the accused in 1987 itself.,2

250,"The evidence of the purported eye-witnesses PWs 1, 2 and 12, if considered in their entirety, are quite cogent and credible and the same could not be shaken during cross-examination.",1
251,"Moreover, there is no reason for these young girls to falsely implicate the appellants as it would be their endeavour to see that the real culprits responsible for the murder of their father got punished.",0

253,"The evidence of the victim's wife PW 5 and the victim's son PW 13, who were the immediate post-occurrence witnesses to the incident also supported the prosecution case in good measure.",1
254,"Despite being relations, they too were the most natural witnesses and they would be more interested to see that the real guilty were punished.",0

256,"It is also quite significant that PW 6, an independent witness, had seen the accused Mohanlal who stayed in another village, sometime before the incident near the place of occurrence.",0
