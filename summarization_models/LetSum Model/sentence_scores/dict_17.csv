27,17) was driving a lorry bearing No.WB 29A 5124 being accompanied with his helper Gurupada Bera (P.W.1) and one Sk.,0

29,"At about 7.15 a.m. two vehicles, one white coloured and another sky-blue coloured Maruti car intercepted the lorry and 6-7 miscreants alighted from the said vehicles.",0
30,They physically assaulted Subash and his helper Gorupada and dragged them inside the white coloured vehicle while Bablu was dragged inside the Suzuki car.,0
31,"Thereafter, they were drived to Lodhasuli jungle where the miscreants left them tied by ropes to standing trees.",0
32,Somehow they escaped and went to Lodhasuli P.S.,0
33,"Thereafter, they went to Tamluk P.S.",0
34,where first information report was registered by Subhas resulting in institution of the present case.,1

44,Charges were framed against the appellants and one Monir Mohammad under Sections 395/412 of the Indian Penal Code.,1
45,It was the defence of the appellants that they have been falsely implicated in this case.,1
46,Their identification in Court during T.I.,0
47,"Parade by P.W.s 1, 2 and 17 were of little substance as they had been shown to the witnesses while in police custody.",0
48,"In the course of trial, the prosecution examined twenty-nine witnesses and exhibited a number of documents.",0
49,"In conclusion of trial, the trial judge by the impugned judgment and order dated 31.08.2016 and 02.09.2016 convicted and sentenced the appellants, as aforesaid.",4

79,6-7 miscreants alighted from the vehicles and had forcibly removed the said witnesses from the lorry carrying human hair.,1
80,P.Ws.1 and 17 were forced into the white coloured vehicle while P.W.2 was forcefully put into the sky coloured Maruti Suzuki car.,0
81,Thereafter they were driven to a nearby jungle and the miscreants tied them to standing trees and left.,0
82,They somehow untied themselves and went to the local police station.,0
83,"Although they initially went to Lodhasuli outpost, PW17 lodged FIR (Ext.9) at Tamluk police station.",0
84,"Although such conduct on the part of P.W.17 cannot be said to be unnatural, it is important to note that the said witness had not disclosed features and other particulars relating to age, built and height of the miscreants in the first information report.",2
85,All the witnesses in cross-examination admitted that they remained in the police station for a number of days upon suspicion that they may have had a hand in the dacoity.,1

88,"Under such circumstances, identification of the appellants by the said witnesses during T.I.",0
89,parade as well as in court loses significance.,0
90,It is pertinent to note that the learned Magistrates (P.W.23 and 28) who conducted T.I.,0
91,"Parade, had noted their T.I.",0
92,Parade reports (Exts.11 and 13) that the appellants had complained that they had been shown to the witnesses at the police station.,0
93,"Trial Judge, however, relied on the identification of the aforesaid witnesses on the premises that P.W.17 had claimed that they had seen the miscreants for the first time at the place of occurrence.",1
94,I am unimpressed by such reasoning.,0
95,P.W.17 had not described the features and other particulars of the miscreants in the first information report.,0
96,P.Ws.1 and 2 also did not describe the features of the miscreants in earlier statements to the Investigating Officer (P.W.29).,0
97,"In the absence of the description of the miscreants in their earlier statements to police, it is highly unsafe to rely on the ipse dixit of the witnesses that they had seen the appellants at the place of occurrence.",0
98,It is relevant to note such identification of the appellants both in Court as well as in T.I.,0
99,Parade admitted that they had seen the appellants in the police station prior to the T.I.,0
100,Parade Examination has to be taken with a pinch of salt as the witnesses.,0
101,It was incumbent on the Investigating Agency to ensure that the identity of the accused persons is not disclosed to the aforesaid witnesses in the course of investigation prior to holding T.I.,0
