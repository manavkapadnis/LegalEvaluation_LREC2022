136,16\.,0
137,These are the important statements in the charge-sheet.,0
138,The position that emerges from all these statements is that the widow of the deceased had specifically stated that accused Somnath was shouting that nobody should take enmity with the present applicants otherwise they would meet the same fate as Pintu.,2
139,If this statement is read in the light of the statement of Ravindra Jagtap ; a clear connection between accused Somanth and present applicants is established.,0
140,"In July 2018, this witness Ravindra had actually heard all the accused including present applicants planning to commit murder of the deceased.",1
141,"The FIR and other statements show that, there was previous enmity and the present applicants had strong motive to commit murder of the deceased.",0
142,"Therefore, at this stage it cannot be said that, the applicants had no connection whatsoever with the planning and execution of conspiracy to commit murder of the deceased.",1
143,The charge-sheet is filed against the other accused.,2
144,"Purti Parab 10 of 12 However, the investigating agency did not yet interrogate the present applicants by taking them in custody.",0
145,This is a serious offence and it requires interrogation of the applicants.,0
146,"At this stage, it is not possible to observe that, the allegations against the present applicants are baseless.",0
147,"In view of the above discussion, the custodial interrogation of the present applicants is absolutely necessary.",0
148,"Therefore, no relief of anticipatory bail can be granted to the applicants.",0
