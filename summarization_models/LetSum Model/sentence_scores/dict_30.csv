16,"Undisputedly, the Signature Not Verified plaintiff Digitally signed by SATISH KUMAR YADAV Date: 2019.01.29 17:11:58 IST Moti Ram had no document of title to prove his Reason: possession, but claimed possessory title based on prior possession for a number of years.",0
17,"However, according to the plaintiff, he had been wrongly dispossessed by defendants on 30.04.1972, which was within the 12 years preceding the filing of the present suit.",2
18,The Trial Court decreed the suit and the First Appellate Court reversed the findings of the Trial Court.,1
19,The First Appellate Court dismissed the said suit on the ground that the defendants had proved their title and possession over the suit property.,3
20,"3 As mentioned supra, the plaintiff did not have any title deed with respect to the suit property.",2
21,"He based his claim mainly on his alleged long possession over the property, and claimed that there was nobody with better title over it than him.",0
22,"Per contra, the defendants relied on two sale deeds, viz., Ex.",1
23,"A−6 dated 06.02.1956, executed by the original owner Khoom Singh in favour of Purkha Ram, and Ex.",1

26,"It was also not disputed that the plaintiff did not have possession as on the date of filing of the suit, inasmuch as he has alleged that he was wrongly dispossessed by the defendant on 30.04.1972, prior to filing the suit.",1

30,"The only questions to be decided in this appeal are whether the plaintiff had better title over the suit property and whether he was in settled possession of the property, which required dispossession in accordance with law.",2
31,5\.,0
32,"Ms. Christi Jain, learned counsel appearing for the appellant/Defendant No.",1
33,"1, taking us through the material on record, contends that there is nothing on record to show that the plaintiff was in possession of the property at any point of time, much less for a longer time lawfully.",1
34,There is no material to show that the plaintiff has possessory title over the suit property.,1
35,"Additionally, she argues that the sale deeds mentioned supra relied upon by the defendants would clearly reveal that the defendants were in possession of the property as owner thereof, from the date of purchase of the suit property.",2
36,6\.,0
37,"Undisputedly and as duly admitted by both parties, the property in question originally belonged to Jagirdar Khoom Singh of Barmer.",0
38,"The property in question is part of a larger property under the Jagirdari system, a few parts of which were rented out or sold.",0
39,"After the system of Jagirdari was abolished, these jagirs were resumed in the year 1955−56.",1
40,"While a few persons continued in illegal possession, others had purchased parts of the land from the Jagirdar, and the remaining land vested in the State Government and municipalities.",2
41,"After the resumption of the jagir, it seems that the Barmer Municipality established a planned and well−managed colony named Nehru Nagar on the said land.",0

47,"Further, the possession of Purkha Ram has also been indicated on a plot to the south of the land duly possessed by Moti Ram.",0
48,"Thus, it is clear that the plots of land owned by Khoom Singh, in possession of these persons, were not uniformly situated.",0
49,"However, after the Municipality took over possession, it seems that orderly formation of the plots was undertaken.",0
50,"Though there was some confusion raised by the plaintiff with regard to the boundaries of the property in question, the First Appellate Court being the final court of fact, on due appreciation of the entire material on record, gave a definite finding that the Trial Court was not justified in decreeing the suit, and observed that Purkha Ram was in possession of the property in question even prior to 1966, and had sold the same through registered sale deed in June 1966 vide Ex.",8

52,"This sale deed shows the measurement of the land, which corresponds to the plots in question approximately.",0
53,"The judgment of the First Appellate Court reveals that the Municipality had let out only three plots to the Jagirdar, and those three plots together measured 32 x 66 hands (unit of measurement).",0

71,"Section 64 of the Limitation Act, 1963 contemplates a suit for possession of immovable property based on previous possession and not on title, if brought within 12 years from the date of dispossession.",4
72,Such a suit is known in law as a suit based on possessory title as distinguishable from proprietary title.,0
73,It cannot be disputed and is by now well settled that settled possession or effective possession of a person without title entitles him to protect his possession as if he were a true owner.,0

75,"The law in India, as it has developed, accords with jurisprudential thought as propounded by luminaries like Salmond.",0
76,Salmond on Jurisprudence (12 Edn.,0
77,"at paras 59−60) states:− ""These two concepts of ownership and possession, therefore, may be used to distinguish between the de facto possessor of an object and its de jure owner, between the man who actually has it and the man who ought to have it.",1
78,"They serve also to contract the position of one whose rights are ultimate, permanent and residual with that of one whose rights are only of a temporary nature.",0
79,x x x x x In English law possession is a good title of right against any one who cannot show a better.,0
80,A wrongful possessor has the rights of an owner with respect to all persons except earlier possessors and except the true owner himself.,0
81,"Many other legal systems, however, go much further than this, and treat possession as a provisional or temporary title even against the true owner himself.",0
82,"Even a wrongdoer, who is deprived of his possession, can recover it from any person whatever, simply on the ground of his possession.",0
83,"Even the true owner, who takes his own, may be forced in this way to restore it to the wrongdoer, and will not be permitted to set up his own superior title to it.",1
84,"He must first give up possession, and then proceed in due course of law for the recovery of the thing on the ground of his ownership.",1
85,"The intention of the law is that every possessor shall be entitled to retain and recover his possession, until deprived of it by a judgment according to law.",0
86,"Legal remedies thus appointed for the protection of possession even against ownership are called possessory, while those available for the protection of ownership itself may be distinguished as proprietary.",1
87,"In the modern and medieval civil law the distinction is expressed by the contrasted terms petitorium (a proprietary suit) and possessorium (a possessory suit).""",1

89,"As far back as 1924, in the case of Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd. v. Naresh Narayan Roy, AIR 1924 PC 144, the learned Judge observed that in India, persons are not permitted to take forcible possession; they must obtain such possession as they are entitled to through a court.",6
90,"Later, in the case of Nair Service Society Ltd. v. K.C.",3
91,"Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165, this Court ruled that when the facts disclose no title in either party, possession alone decides.",3
92,"It was further held that if Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (corresponding to the present Section 6) is employed, the plaintiff need not prove title and the title of the defendant does not avail him.",4
93,"When, however, the period of six months has passed, questions of title can be raised by the defendant, and if he does so the plaintiff must establish a better title or fail.",2
94,"In other words, such a right is only restricted to possession in a suit under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act (corresponding to the present Section 6) but does not bar a suit on prior possession within 12 years from the date of dispossession, and title need not be proved unless the defendant can provide one.",4

97,"on 29 January, 2019 11\.",2
98,It was also observed by this Court in Nair Service Society Ltd (supra) that a person in possession of land in assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly good title against the entire world except the rightful owner.,3
99,"In such a case, the defendant must show in himself or his predecessor a valid legal title and probably a possession prior to the plaintiffs, and thus be able to raise a presumption prior in time.",1

103,"and another, (2004) 1 SCC 769, a three−Judge Bench of this Court, while discussing the Indian law on the subject, observed as under:− 8.",3
104,It is thus clear that so far as the Indian law is concerned the person in peaceful possession is entitled to retain his possession and in order to protect such possession he may even use reasonable force to keep out a trespasser.,2
105,A rightful owner who has been wrongfully dispossessed of land may retake possession if he can do so peacefully and without the use of unreasonable force.,1
106,"If the trespasser is in settled possession of the property belonging to the rightful owner, the rightful owner shall have to take recourse to law; he cannot take the law in his own hands and evict the trespasser or interfere with his possession.",0
107,"The law will come to the aid of a person in peaceful and settled possession by injuncting even a rightful owner from using force or taking law in his own hands, and also by restoring him in possession even from the rightful owner (of course subject to the law of limitation), if the latter has dispossessed the prior possessor by use of force.",1
108,"In the absence of proof of better title, possession or prior peaceful settled possession is itself evidence of title.",0
109,Law presumes the possession to go with the title unless rebutted.,0
110,"The owner of any property may prevent even by using reasonable force a trespasser from an attempted trespass, when it is in the process of being committed, or is of a flimsy character, or recurring, intermittent, stray or casual in nature, or has just been committed, while the rightful owner did not have enough time to have recourse to law.",1
111,"In the last of the cases, the possession of the trespasser, just entered into would not be called as one acquiesced to by the true owner.",0
112,13\.,0
113,The crux of the matter is that a person who asserts possessory title over a particular property will have to show that he is under settled or established possession of the said property.,0
114,But merely stray or intermittent acts of trespass do not give such a right against the true owner.,0
115,"Settled possession means such possession over the property which has existed for a sufficiently long period of time, and has been acquiesced to by the true owner.",1
116,A casual act of possession does not have the effect of interrupting the possession of the rightful owner.,1
117,"A stray act of trespass, or a possession which has not matured into settled possession, can be obstructed or removed by the true owner even by using necessary force.",1
118,"Settled possession must be (i) effective, (ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser.",0
119,There cannot be a straitjacket formula to determine settled possession.,0
120,Occupation of a property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual legal possession.,2
121,The possession should contain an element of animus possidendi.,0
122,The nature of possession of the trespasser is to be decided based on the facts and circumstances of each case.,1
