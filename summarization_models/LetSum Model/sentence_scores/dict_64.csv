70,It is for the prosecution to prove that there is a perversity in the finding given by the trial Court.,2

72,"18.The learned counsel for the State would submit that in order to avoid in filing of the false case against P.W2, A1 demanded money as bribe and at his instructions A2 received the same.",4
73,"On 22.07.2006, the defacto complainant went to the police station.",0

75,"19.Then the defacto complainant went to the police station on 24.07.2006 and met A1, who in turn asked as to why the other four persons did not come with him and for which he replied that he brought a sum of Rs.3,000/- as demanded by him and A1 told that already there was a raid in the police station and due to the same, he was not able to receive the money directly.",0
76,"Therefore, he asked http://www.judis.nic.in him to wait outside for some time.",0

79,"From the evidence of P.W2 and P.W3 coupled with P.W9 and P.W10, the prosecution has proved its case against both the accused.",1

98,"Trap Laying Officer conducted the phenolpthalien test, which proved positive and thereafter, the tainted money was recovered.",0
99,Then recovery magazar was prepared and the matter was placed before the Investigating Officer.,0
100,"http://www.judis.nic.in 26.On reading of the evidence of P.W2, the defacto complainant narrated the events.",0
101,"On a perusal of records, Ex.P7 to Ex.P17 clearly show that there was a complaint received against the theft of electric motor and therefore, P.W2 was suspected with many other persons by the respondent police.",0
102,"27.PW.2 had further deposed that since he was not willing to give the money as bribe, he filed a complaint on 24.07.2006.",2
103,"Subsequently, after registering the case, the respondent police conducted the pre trap demonstration proceedings and thereafter, the defacto complainant was told by A1 that he should come to the police station next day i.e., on 25.07.2006 with the other four suspected persons and each one should bring a sum of Rs.3,000/- and the same was reported before the Trap Laying Officer and also he instructed P.W2 if he was interested would come on the next day i.e., on 25.07.2006 and on that day also he came and approached the Trap Laying Officer.",0
104,"28.After completing the procedural formalities on 25.07.2006 at 12.45 p.m., P.W2 and P.W3 were asked to go to the police station, where A1 is working and instruction was given, if A1 demanded money, then only he should hand over the money to him http://www.judis.nic.in in the presence of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/ 6 A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019 P.W3.",5
105,"Thereafter, P.W2 had entered into the police station and again A1 asked about the other suspected persons and P.W2 told that he was not aware of them and not concerned about the other persons and then A1 told P.W2 to wait for some time at the outside of the police station because recently there was a raid in the police station and due to the same he did not want to receive the bribe money directly.",0
106,"Therefore, P.W2 and P.W3 were waiting outside the police station.",0
107,"Thereafter, after reaching A2 to the police station, he went and sat opposite to A1, after 5 minutes A1 called P.W2 and P.W3 and asked P.W2 to hand over the money to A2 by showing his hand and stated that he would get from him later.",2
108,"Accordingly, P.W2 also handed over the tainted money to A2, A2 also received the same and kept with him.",0
109,"29.From a reading of the entire evidence of P.W2 and P.W3, P.W2 had never engaged A2 as his counsel not only in this case but also in any other case.",2
110,"Therefore, there is no relationship between A2 and P.W2 as counsel and client.",0
111,"Though A1 has stated that he has not demanded any money and not accepted the money, no recovery has been made from him, at the same time, the bribe money was transferred only in the police station in the presence of A1 and from the evidence of P.W2 and P.W3, the prosecution has http://www.judis.nic.in clearly proved its case that A1 demanded money from P.W2 and he wanted to receive the bribe money from the other suspected persons also, who were all alleged to have been suspected in the electric motor theft case.",4
112,"Since the other persons have not come on 24.07.2006, A1 did not receive the money and told him that if the other persons do not come with a sum of Rs.3,000/- as bribe, he would register the case against P.W2.",1
113,"So, in the name of enquiry, A1 called the persons and demanded money for not registering the case against P.W2.",1
114,"30.From the evidence of P.W3, it is seen that he is neither the friend of P.W2 nor working in the office of the Trap Laying Team and he is the independent witness.",0
115,"He has clearly stated that when he went along with P.W2 on 24.07.2006, A1 demanded money and asked as to whether P.W2 has brought the money and told him to come on the next day i.e., on 25.07.2006 and bring the other suspected persons also.",2
116,"On 25.07.2006, A1 demanded money and at the time he has ascertained from P.W2 as to whether he has brought the bribe money.",0
117,"When P.W2 gave the money to A1, he told that since there was a raid in the police station in the recent past, he did not want to receive the money directly.",0
118,He asked P.W2 and P.W3 to wait for some time.,0
119,After A2 reaching the office of A1 http://www.judis.nic.in was sitting opposite to A1.,0
120,5 minutes later he called P.W2 inside the office of A1 and at the time again they reiterated the demand and ascertained as to whether P.W2 has brought the money.,0
121,"As per the direction of A1, P.W2 and P.W3 were waiting outside the police station and subsequently A2 received the money from P.W2 and A2 was not disputed the same and P.W2 and P.W3 have clearly stated that A1 demanded money for not registering a false case against P.W2.",3
122,P.W2 has not engaged A2 as his counsel either for the said electric motor theft case or in any other case.,2
123,"Though he has received the money on behalf of A1, A1 demanded bribe money in order to avoid any complication, he received the tainted money through A2.",1
124,The money received by A2 was not for him it is only for A1.,0
125,"From the evidence of P.W2 and P.W3, it is clear that A1 told P.W2 by showing his hand towards A2, who was sitting just opposite to A1 that give to A2 and he would receive from him.",0
126,"31.Under these circumstances, on reading of the entire evidence of P.W2, after showing the pre arranged signals, the Trap Laying team entered into the police station and they also conducted the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/ 7 A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019 phynopthalin test and the result is also positive.",5
127,"Therefore, it is clear that A1 received the money from P.W2 through A2.",0
128,"http://www.judis.nic.in 32.The learned counsel for A2 would submit that A2 was neither arrested nor signature was obtained from him in the mahazar, which shows that A2 received the money only as professional fee.",1
129,"Since he was not arrested on the said day, no signature was obtained from A2 in the magazars, which shows that A2 has not committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution.",0
130,"33.On reading of the suggestion put before P.W2, P.W2 handed over the money to A2, for having engaged A2 and A2 has taken the stand that A2 received the money only as professional fee and not as bribe money.",0
131,34.The evidence of P.W3 clearly shows that A1 demanded money on 24.07.2006 and on 25.07.2006 A2 received the money from P.W2 only for A1 as bribe money and not professional fee and P.W2 has not engaged A2 as his counsel at any point of time not only in the said theft case but also any other cases.,1
132,"In the absence of any materials to show that he was engaged by P.W2 as his counsel, the defence taken by A2 is not acceptable.",0
133,"35.On a conjoint reading of the materials placed before this Court, the entire evidence and the witnesses, P.Ws.,5, 6 and 7, the http://www.judis.nic.in defence that on 22.07.2006, P.W2 asked A2 to stand as his counsel for defending his case.",3
134,"Since P.Ws., 5, 6 and 7 were also the suspected persons, they are within the jurisdiction of A1 and that there is no documentary evidence to show that P.W2 engaged A2 as his counsel not only in the said theft case and also any other cases, pending before the police station, in which A1 was working.",2
135,"Under these circumstances, there is a perversity in the appreciation of evidence of the prosecution against A2 and wrongly acquitted him.",0
136,"36.On reading of the entire materials placed before this Court and considering the arguments advanced by the learned counsel on either side, absolutely there is no quarrel with the legal proposition in the referred to judgments.",1
137,"But in this case on hand, on reading of the entire materials especially Ex.P7 to Ex.P17 have been recovered from the police station and the evidence of P.Ws., 2, 3, 4 and 10 clearly show that P.W2 was taken to the police station for enquiry in a theft case.",2
138,"At the time, A1 demanded money and also accepted the same through A2 and therefore, A2 has committed the offence and he was not engaged by P.W2 as his counsel not only in the said theft case and also any other cases.",1
139,"Therefore, the defence taken by the accused is not believable.",0
140,"The defence taken by the A-2 is only an afterthought and in order to escape from the clutch of the http://www.judis.nic.in law, he has made a false defence without any substance.",1
141,Mere taking bald defence without any material is not acceptable.,0
142,"37.Under these circumstances, this Court finds that A1 and A2 have committed the offence and on a reading of the entire materials especially the witnesses P.Ws., 2, 3, 4 and 10, the prosecution has proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt against A1 and A2.",2
143,"38.The learned counsel for the accused would submit that no statement was recorded from the accused soon after the completion of trap, the same is violated the Rule 47 of the Vigilance Manual.",1
144,"Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/ 8 A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019 The Vigilance Manual is only a guideline and the same is directory and not mandatory.",5
145,Mere non recording of the statement as per the rules in the manual is not vitiating the case of the prosecution.,1
146,"39.The prosecution evidence clearly shows that A1 demanded money initially and thereafter, received the same as bribe through A2.",0
147,"Therefore, the violation of Rule 47 or any other Rule of the Vigilance Manual will not vitiate the case.",1
148,"Regarding the non application of mind by Sanction Authority is concerned, even though P.W1 has stated in his evidence that he had perused the statement of the accused, it is not the sole ground to acquit the accused when http://www.judis.nic.in the Sanction Authority has gone through the entire materials and accorded sanction.",1
149,On reading of the sanction order and the evidence of P.W1 shows that he has applied his mind before according the sanction.,0
150,"Therefore, there is nothing wrong in the sanction accorded by P.W1.",0
151,40.The demand is proved through P.W2 and P.W3 and further the acceptance is also proved though P.W2 and P.W3 in the manner known to law by the prosecution.,0
152,The tainted money was also recovered from A2 and he stated that he received the money from P.W2 as professional fee.,2
153,The same was not proved with substitutive materials that he was engaged by P.W2 when P.W2 denied about his engagement.,0
