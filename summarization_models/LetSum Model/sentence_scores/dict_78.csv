89,"3.9 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court, the original defendants have preferred the 6 present appeal.",3

91,"3511/1992 only, vide which the High Court has allowed the said appeal preferred by the original plaintiff and consequently has decreed the suit for specific performance of agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 in favour of the original plaintiff.",4
92,4\.,0
93,Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants – original defendants has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has materially erred in quashing and setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court dismissing the suit on the ground of limitation.,7
94,4.1 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants – original defendants that the High Court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the learned trial Court rightly dismissed the suit on the ground of limitation applying Article 54 of the Limitation Act.,5
95,"It is submitted that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, Article 113 of the Limitation Act shall not be applicable.",1
96,4.2 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants – original defendants that as per the original agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 the sale deed was required to be executed within four months from the date of execution of the agreement to sell and even the same was extended up to 6.5.1982 only.,3
97,It is submitted that therefore the limitation for filing the suit by 7 the plaintiff would be three years from 6.5.1982 as provided under Article 54 of the Limitation Act.,3
98,It is submitted therefore as rightly held by the learned trial Court the suit of the plaintiff was barred under Article 54 of the Limitation Act.,4
99,4.3 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants – original defendants that the High Court ought to have seen that taking a stray sentence in Ex.A1 (agreement to sell) that vendor has to settle all the disputes in the property cannot be termed as implied covenant.,1
100,"4.4 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants – original defendants that the High Court ought to have appreciated that there has been a valid sale by the widow of the vendor in favour of appellant no.2 herein – Bogilla Satyanarayana Murthy and the said sale deed was acted upon by the widow and as she was in possession, she put appellant no.2 herein into possession of the suit property.",2

102,It is submitted that appellant no.2 herein – original defendant no.2 is a purchaser without notice of the existence of the earlier agreement and on payment of full sale consideration.,2

109,"5.3 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein - original plaintiff that after the execution of the agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 and after the time to make the payment and execution of the sale deed was extended by a further period of eight months, the land acquisition proceedings were initiated and it was the plaintiff who challenged the acquisition proceedings and in the petition filed by him the acquisition proceedings came to be set aside and the writ petition was allowed.",8

111,A1 it was for the 9 vendor to settle all the disputes in the property.,0

113,It is submitted that therefore Article 113 of the Limitation Act would be applicable and the same is rightly applied by the High Court.,1

115,It is submitted that however it was their defence that the said agreement to sell was to defeat the land acquisition proceedings.,1
116,"It is submitted that therefore when the agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 has been admitted by the defendants and the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract and all throughout it was the plaintiff who challenged the acquisition proceedings which shows the bonafides on the part of the plaintiff, the High Court has rightly allowed the appeal and consequently has rightly decreed the suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981.",6
117,5.5 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein - original plaintiff that as such there is no appeal preferred by the defendants challenging the impugned common judgment and order passed 10 by the High Court insofar as dismissing their appeals being Tr.A.S.,4
118,No.,1
119,439/2006 and Tr.A.S.,0

124,55/1986 and also confirmed the judgment and decree of permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff in O.S.,2
125,No.,1
126,94/1989.,0
127,5.6 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein - original plaintiff that as such the plaintiff is in possession of the suit property since 1981 and therefore also the present appeal is required to be dismissed.,7
128,5.7 It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein - original plaintiff that even otherwise and with a view to put an end to the litigation the plaintiff is ready and willing to pay some more amount than what is required to be paid under the agreement to sell.,2
129,"5.8 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.",2
130,6\.,0
131,"In reply, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants – original defendants has submitted that if the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is set aside and the property/land in question is reverted back to the appellants -, the appellants are ready and willing to pay a handsome amount to the plaintiff.",7
132,7\.,0
133,We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length and perused and considered the impugned common judgment and order passed by 11 the High Court as well as the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court.,5
134,"7.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that the original plaintiff instituted the suit for specific performance of agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 (Ex.A1).",1
135,"It is not in dispute that under the agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981, the sale deed was to be executed within a period of four months from the date of execution of agreement to sell i.e.",3
136,7.5.1981.,0
137,"However, thereafter time was extended by a further period of eight months i.e.",1
138,up to 6.5.1982.,0
139,"However, before any further steps could be taken by the plaintiff and the original vendor, the suit property was subjected to the acquisition by the State Government.",4
140,It was the plaintiff who made a representation to the Assistant Collector and requested for deletion of the property from the acquisition.,1
141,A similar representation was made by the original vendor also.,0
142,It is required to be noted that in the representations both the vendor and the vendee specifically stated that the land in question has been sold in favour of the plaintiff and that he is in possession.,5
143,"Therefore, the original vendor as such admitted the execution of the agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 as well as handing over the possession of the suit property to the plaintiff.",4
144,"Therefore, the learned trial Court as such rightly believed the execution of the agreement to sell dated 7.5.1981 as well as handing over of possession to the plaintiff.",5
145,The same is rightly confirmed by the High Court.,0
146,"7.2 However, the trial Court dismissed the suit solely on the ground that the suit for specific performance was barred by limitation applying Article 54 of the 12 Limitation Act.",3
147,"On the other hand, it was the specific case on behalf of the plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case Article 113 of the Limitation Act shall be applicable as the suit was filed within a period of three years when the right to sue accrued.",5
148,"According to the plaintiff, the right to sue accrued when the plaintiff served a notice upon the defendants to execute the sale deed and the defendants refused to execute the sale deed.",3
149,"At this stage, it is required to be noted that under the agreement to sell it was for the vendor to settle all the disputes in the property.",0
150,"As the land in question was subjected to the acquisition and thereafter the acquisition proceedings came to be quashed and set aside at the instance of the plaintiff in the year 1984/1985 and thereafter the plaintiff served a legal notice upon the defendants on 20.01.1986 calling upon the defendants to execute the sale deed which came to be refused by reply notice dated 31.1.1986 and thereafter the suit for specific performance was preferred, as rightly observed by the High Court, Article 113 of the Limitation Act would be applicable and not Article 54 of the Limitation Act as applied by the learned trial Court.",10
151,We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court in applying Article 113 of the Limitation Act.,1
152,"As observed hereinabove, the learned trial Court dismissed the suit solely on the ground that the suit is barred by limitation considering Article 54 of the Limitation Act though all other findings with respect to the execution of agreement to sell., the plaintiff was put in possession etc.",6
153,were held to be in favour of the plaintiff.,2
154,"13 7.3 Therefore applying Article 113 of the Limitation Act to the facts of the case on hand and the conduct of the plaintiff all throughout to protect not only his possession but to protect the property from acquisition and that he was always ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement to sell/contract, the High Court has rightly decreed the suit for specific performance.",3
155,We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court.,0
156,"7.4 However, at the same time, considering the fact that the agreement to sell was executed in the year 1981 for a total sale consideration of Rs.59,200/- and at the relevant time Rs.26,500/- was paid as an earnest money and all throughout the plaintiff enjoyed the possession and thereafter by now about 40 years have passed and as agreed by the plaintiff to pay some more amount to the defendants, over and above the sale consideration as mentioned in the agreement to sell, which he has agreed to pay to put an end to the litigation and to buy peace, while dismissing the present appeal, we direct that the plaintiff shall pay a total sum of Rs.15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) to the defendants towards the full sale consideration, which shall be inclusive of the balance amount of sale consideration to be paid to the defendants under the agreement to sell, to be paid within a period of eight weeks from today.",10
157,"On payment of the aforesaid amount of Rs.15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) to the original defendants by the original plaintiff, immediately thereafter the original defendants are directed to execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff.",4
158,14 8\.,0
159,"With the aforesaid observations and directions, the present appeal stands disposed of, however, no order as to costs.",1
