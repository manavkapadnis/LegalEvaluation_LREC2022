220,The appellant has relied upon the judgments of this Court in Mohd.,2
221,Iqbal Ahmed v. State of A.P.2 and State of Karnataka v. Ameerjan3 to challenge the sanction order.,2
222,In Mohd.,0
223,Iqbal Ahmed (supra) it was observed that a valid sanction is the one that is granted by the Sanctioning Authority after being satisfied that a case for sanction is made out constituting the offence.,2
224,It is important to be mindful of the observations made by the Court as reproduced below: 3\.,0
225,"[] what the Court has to see is whether or not the Sanctioning Authority at the time of giving sanction was aware of the facts constituting the offence and applied its mind for the same Similarly, in Ameerjan (supra), it was observed: 10\.",0
226,"[] Ordinarily, before passing an order of sanction, the entire records containing the materials collected against the accused should be placed before (1979) 4 SCC 172 (2007) 11 SCC 273 the sanctioning authority.",0
227,"In the event, the order of sanction does not indicate application of mind as (sic to) the materials placed before the said authority before the order of sanction was passed, the same may be produced before the court to show materials had in fact been produced.",2
228,"Therefore, what the law requires is the application of mind by the Sanctioning Authority on the material placed before it to satisfy itself of prima facie case that would constitute the offence.",1
229,"On the said aspect, the later decision of this Court in State of Maharashtra v. Mahesh G. Jain4 has referred to several decisions to expound on the following principles of law governing the validity of sanction: 14.1.",4
230,It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the valid sanction has been granted by the sanctioning authority after being satisfied that a case for sanction has been made out.,1

239,14.5.,0
240,The adequacy of material placed before the sanctioning authority cannot be gone into by the court as it does not sit in appeal over the sanction order.,1
241,(2013) 8 SCC 119 14.6.,0
242,If the sanctioning authority has perused all the materials placed before it and some of them have not been proved that would not vitiate the order of sanction.,0
243,14.7.,0
244,"The order of sanction is a prerequisite as it is intended to provide a safeguard to a public servant against frivolous and vexatious litigants, but simultaneously an order of sanction should not be construed in a pedantic manner and there should not be a hypertechnical approach to test its validity.",0
245,"The contention of the appellant, therefore, fails and is rejected.",2
246,19\.,0
247,"The last contention of the appellant is predicated on Section 17 of the Act and the fact that the investigation in the present case was not conducted by the police officer by the rank and status of the Deputy Superintendent of Police or equal, but by Inspector Rohtash Singh (PW-5) and Inspector Shobhan Singh (PW-7).",7
248,"The contention has to be rejected for the reason that while this lapse would be an irregularity and unless the irregularity has resulted in causing prejudice, the conviction will not be vitiated and bad in law.",2
249,"The appellant has not alleged or even argued that any prejudice was caused and suffered because the investigation was conducted by the police officer of the rank of Inspector, namely Rohtash Singh (PW-5) and Shobhan Singh (PW-7).",1

251,"This Court in Ashok Tshering Bhutia v. State of Sikkim5 referring to the earlier precedents has observed that a defect or irregularity in investigation however serious, would have no direct bearing on the competence or procedure relating to cognizance or trial.",5
252,"Where the cognizance of the case has already been taken and the case has proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the precedent investigation does not vitiate the result, unless a miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby.",1
253,Similar is the position with regard to the validity of the sanction.,0
254,"A mere error, omission or irregularity in sanction is not considered to be fatal unless it has resulted in a failure of justice or has been occasioned thereby.",1
255,"Section 19(1) of the Act is matter of procedure and does not go to the root of the jurisdiction and once the cognizance has been taken by the court under the Code, it cannot be said that an invalid police report is the foundation of jurisdiction of the court to take cognizance and for that matter the trial.",4
