100,2 to 5 are convicted by the Learned Trial Court and the High Court solely relying upon the evidence/deposition of PW8 – Mullo Bai.,1
101,It cannot be disputed that there can be a conviction relying upon the evidence/deposition of the sole witness.,0

103,"Therefore, the question which is posed for consideration of this Court is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, can the appellants herein – original accused nos.",2
104,2 to 5 be convicted relying upon the deposition of the sole witness – PW8 and whether PW8 is a reliable and trustworthy witness to convict the appellants herein- original accused nos.,0

111,She has stated that Bal Kishan – original accused no.1 was having an axe and other four were armed with lathis.,2
112,She had also stated in her statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C.,4
113,that Bal Kishan – original accused no.1 gave the axe blow on the neck of the deceased due to the enmity and earlier dispute and other accused were telling to run away immediately and thereafter all the five accused ran away from behind the cattle shed/house.,0

128,that the appellants herein – accused nos.,0
129,2 to 5 were having lathis.,0
130,"However, as per the settled preposition of law a statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.",4
131,is inadmissible in evidence and cannot be relied upon or used to convict the accused.,0
132,"As per the settled proposition of law, the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.",4
133,can be used only to prove the contradictions and/or omissions.,0
134,"Therefore, as such, the High Court has erred in relying upon the statement of PW8 recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.",3
135,while observing that the appellants were having the lathis.,0
136,"14.2 As observed hereinabove in her statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., she has never stated that accused Santosh and Rakesh caught hold of Bal Kishan, but stated that the appellants herein told to run away as other persons have woken.",7
137,"In the facts and circumstances of the case, there are material contradictions, omissions and/or improvements so far as the appellants herein – original accused nos.",0
