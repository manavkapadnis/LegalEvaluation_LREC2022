10,"2 The Court : Both these appeals arise out of an order dated September 18, 2017 pertaining to the acquisition of land by the Kolkata Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127999847/ 1 Debraj Dhur & Ors vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 16 December, 2019 Municipal Corporation for the construction of a road in the Sinthee area.",10
11,"According to the writ petitioners, no previous notice for acquisition was issued to the owners of the land by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the land was acquired in or about the year 1996-97.",2
12,"Though KMC maintains that due notice had been served and the land- owners had also been informed of the quantum of compensation that was payable to them, the writ petitioners in this case insist that neither was any previous notice issued to the petitioners nor was any offer made to receive compensation prior to the road being constructed on the writ petitioners' land.",2
13,It appears that an initial writ petition was instituted in the year 2002 for the writ petitioners' land having been taken over by the Corporation without any compensation being paid therefor.,4
14,"Such petition came to be disposed of on July 16, 2002 after recording that the Commissioner had taken a decision for the payment of compensation and that such decision would be conveyed to the writ petitioners and the payment made within one month.",3
15,"The writ court observed that in view of such submission, the writ petition had become ""infructuous"".",1
16,"However, the writ court granted the following liberty to the writ petitioners: ""However, if the petitioners are dissatisfied with the amount of compensation, they are free to challenge such decision before the appropriate forum.""",1
17,"3 A second writ petition, WP No.11300(W) of 2003, followed.",0
18,"petition was disposed of by an order dated April 1, 2005.",4
19,"Such In the opening paragraph of the order, the Court observed that the acquisition in this case had taken place without any notice or intimation to the writ petitioners.",3
20,"Such order of April 1, 2005 provided as follows in its operative part: ""In the circumstances, I make it clear that accepting the condition contained in the agreement will not disentitle the petitioner to challenge the quantum of compensation that has Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127999847/ 2 Debraj Dhur & Ors vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 16 December, 2019 been fixed by the agreement in the instant case.",10
21,respondent authorities shall make over the amount of The compensation which has already been fixed by him upon execution of the agreement which was been forwarded to the petitioner.,2
22,"The respondent authorities shall also complete the execution of agreement within a period of four weeks from the date of communication of this order.""",2
23,A third writ petition came to be filed thereafter in the form of the present proceedings.,1
24,"The writ petition in the present case was disposed of with the following observation: ""In view of the peculiar facts involved in the instant case, it is axiomatic to record that the Corporation must adopt the fair, reasonable and just compensation in determining the market value prevalent at the time of its acquisition and not in a whimsical and arbitrary manner as has been done in the instant case.",4
25,"The Petitioners should be allowed to produce the relevant documents touching the market value prevalent at the time of the acquisition and thereafter the Mayor-in-Council, who is otherwise competent to determine the price under sub- Section 2 of Section 536 should fix the same.",4
26,"There also appears to be a serious dispute on the quantum of land actually acquired for such public purpose and therefore, this Court feels it necessary that a joint inspection should be held by the Senior Officers of the Corporation and the representative of the Petitioner to find out the extent of land acquired for widening the road.",2
27,The aforesaid inspection should be done within 8(eight) weeks from the date of the communication of this order.,0
28,"Thereafter, the compensation so determined by the Mayor-in- Council should be reflected in the said agreement and all endeavor shall be made to execute the same within 4(four) weeks from the date of such joint inspection.""",0
29,Both the writ petitioners and the Corporation are in appeal.,2
30,"According to the writ petitioners, the court of the first instance erred in failing to appreciate that the writ petitioners were entitled to much larger compensation than the mere value of land in the year 1996-97 when the acquisition was made.",3
31,"The Corporation has come up on the ground that since the money was offered sometime in 2002 itself, the Corporation cannot be made liable for any interest for the period thereafter or any additional amount that the writ petitioners may fancy that they are entitled to.",7
32,"The Corporation has referred to Sections 352 and 363 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980 to submit that the Corporation is authorised to acquire land and the quantum of compensation payable by the Corporation is provided for in Section 363 of the said Act.",7
33,"On the other hand, the case run by the writ petitioners is that since no notice of any kind was issued prior to the petitioners' land being taken, the petitioners are entitled to complete restitution or payment at a fair rate.",3
34,"The Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127999847/ 3 Debraj Dhur & Ors vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 16 December, 2019 petitioners do not consider that they would receive just compensation in terms of the order impugned and insist that they are entitled to more.",7
35,"Prima facie, Section 363 of the Act of 1980 appears to be anomalous.",5
36,"It is true that the Act of 1980 contains provisions for acquisition of land by the Corporation, inter alia, to widen roads and the like, but there is no provision in the body of the statute as to how notice would be issued, on whom notice would be issued, or the like.",7
37,"Though there is a system of calculation which has been indicated, yet no mechanism indicated as to how to resolve an issue when the land-loser is dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation.",0
38,"Further, the quantum of compensation indicated in Section 363 of the Act may not be acceptable and Section 363 of the Act of 1980 may even be ultra vires the Constitution.",8
39,"The issue over here is not that because of the lack of initiation of acquisition proceedings, the entire construction undertaken by the Corporation ostensibly for a public purpose must be undone.",1
40,The issue here is what would be the fair compensation due to the petitioners upon the petitioners graciously accepting that their land has been acquired.,0
41,"In such a scenario, particularly, when at the relevant time, there was the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 which guided as to how compensation would be decided, it is difficult to accept that the Act of 1980 in this State would provide for a different methodology for assessment or payment of lesser compensation than would be payable in respect of acquisition of land under the Act of 1894.",4
42,Let a copy of this order be reached to learned Advocate General for the State for learned Advocate General to be represented when the matter is next taken up.,1
43,"What is evident is that despite the murmurs of the Corporation to the contrary, it has been acknowledged at least in one judicial order that no previous notice was issued to the owners of the land prior to its acquisition.",3
44,"Indeed, the owners claim that the extent of acquisition as shown by the Corporation is less than the quantum of the writ petitioners' land that has been taken over by the Corporation for the purpose of construction of the relevant road.",1
45,"Accordingly, the relevant Land Acquisition Collector (I), Kolkata, is directed to conduct a survey with the help of such officials as may be necessary for the purpose.",2
46,The first exercise that the Land Acquisition Collector will conduct is to ascertain the extent of the land acquired by the Corporation and the extent of the land that was lost to the writ petitioners herein as a result of the relevant acquisition.,1
47,"The LA Collector will, next, ascertain the compensation that would have been payable in 1996-97 for the acquisition of such land by the State from any private party in terms of the provisions of the Act of 1894.",4
48,"It will be open to both the Corporation and the writ petitioners to question the report of the LA Collector to be submitted in terms of this order, both in respect of the extent of the land acquired and the quantum of compensation payable.",2
49,This Court will try and assess the compensation payable as a reference would have under Section 18 of the Act of 1894.,5
50,"However, a degree of consensus has to be arrived at as to the quantum of land, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127999847/ 4 Debraj Dhur & Ors vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 16 December, 2019 particularly, since the area of land acquired from the writ petitioners will be evident from the documents of title that the writ petitioners possess, the survey map and other records available to the relevant LA Collector.",6
51,"The LA Collector's report in terms of this order should be available by February 15, 2020.",4
52,"The matters will appear before the appropriate Bench on February 24, 2020 for the parties to indicate the further course of action.",4
53,"Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the parties upon compliance with all requisite formalities.",1
