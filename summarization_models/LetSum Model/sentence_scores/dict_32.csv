28,"The raid/trap in the matter was conducted on 11.10.1996 and at that time appellant was about 41 years old, thus, now he is more than 63 years of his age.",1
29,5\.,0
30,"In this backdrop, Advocate Choube submitted that sanction for prosecution accorded by PW-3 Shubhendu vide Exh.",0
31,33 is vitiated.,0
32,He contends that according sanction under Section 19(a) is not an empty formality and the authority concerned must apply its mind to all relevant parts.,3
33,PW-3 has merely signed the proposed draft for grant of sanction sent by Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) and this act shows total non- application of mind.,1
34,"He relies upon cross-examination of this witness to demonstrate that material papers having bearing on the process of application of mind, were never called for and hence the grant of sanction itself its vitiated and void.",0
35,"Prosecution commenced on its basis and conviction, therefore, cannot be sustained.",2
36,He relies upon judgment of this Court in the matter of Nishikant Bhaskarrao Kulkarni since deceased) through his Legal Heirs (Dr.) & Ors.,3

40,"Without prejudice and in the alternative, learned counsel contends that evidence of PW-1, Complaint & PW-2 Shadow witness and the two officers of the Anti Corruption Bureau is mutually inconsistent and therefore cast a cloud of doubt on entire prosecution version, he states that charge was framed by the Trial Court vide Exhibit No.",4
41,4 on 24.08.2004 and it was denied by appellant who has claimed false implication.,1
42,Burden was therefore on prosecution to show not only the demand and its acceptance but also to prove the trap by cogent and convincing evidence.,0
43,7\.,0
44,He states that complainant PW-1 Keshav s/o Amrut had sought advance from his Provident Fund amount for performing marriage of his daughter.,1
45,The amount is payable as advance and therefore before marriage.,1
46,"Admittedly as per this witness, marriage of his daughter was already performed on scheduled date in May 1996 only.",3
47,"However, thereafter, he incorrectly and falsely represented that the marriage of his daughter was postponed initially to 27th August, 1996, and thereafter pointed out that it was postponed to 10th October, 1996.",2
48,"This inconsistent and false conduct on part of complaint, itself is sufficient to infer an attempt to victimize the officers of Coal Mines Provident Fund Establishment (hereinafter be referred to as 'CMPF' for the sake of brevity).",1
49,By relying upon Exhibit No.,1
50,"12, he submits that the said documents dated 11.10.1996 filed as complaint to Central Bureau of Investigation fact of moving application on 2 nd May, 1996, has been pointed out and he has disclosed that Assistant Clerk in the CMPF Office demanded Rs.",5

62,10\.,0

64,"He submits that PW-4 Biradar Sinha examined by prosecution shows that at 11:00 am accused was not in his seat and when he returned, again he did not see anybody in the office.",0
65,"This witness heard loud noise and people saying that appellant was traped by ACB, he heard this noise at about 11:15 a.m.",1
66,This according to him falsifies the entire prosecution story.,0
67,11\.,0
68,"Learned counsel states that evidence of PW-1, complaint about meeting accused persons on two- three occasions prior to 11.10.1996 is shaky.",0
69,"If he had visited flat (residence) of accused, he could not describe it properly and he also could not explain arrangement inside the flat.",0
70,"Complaint could not explain how from inside or outside, he gave pre-decided Judgment 5 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt signal or removing the spectacles to the others.",0
71,"According to prosecution PW- 2 Maudekar was standing outside the flat and as such, he could not have heard anything.",0
72,"Despite this, PW-2 narrates the talk between accused and PW-1, which took allegedly inside the flat.",0
73,Evidence on record creates doubt about giving of signal.,0
74,It is not clear whether signal was given to Maudekar or then to remaining raiding party with whom ACB Officers and 2 nd Panchanama witness (Part-2) were standing.,0
75,12\.,0
76,"Inviting the attention to deposition of PW-1, he shows a statement that the amount of Rs.",1
77,300/recovered allegedly from shirt pocket of accused was kept in one envelope.,0
78,"However, when prosecutor opened that envelope, amount of Rs.",1
79,800/- was taken out.,0
80,"He further submits that during examination of PW-5 Kanhaiya Sinha, it is again recorded that this envelope was opened and 8 notes were found in it.",0

83,Learned counsel states that amount of Rs.,1
84,"800/- is stated to be agreed amount of bribe and as per prosecution in trap, Rs.",2
85,300/- were recovered from shirt pocket while remaining amount of Rs.,1
86,500/- were taken out of an Almirah in the flat of accused.,0
87,This bifurcation gets lost because all 8 notes were taken out from envelope article P-3.,0
88,This runs counter to story of complainant.,0
89,14\.,0
90,He further states that role of accused in the process of sanctioning of marriage advance has not been brought on record at all.,0
91,"Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 3 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 Judgment 6 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Evidence of PW-6 Ashok Pohankar shows that he was dealing with marriage advance cases and charge was not given to accused at all.",5
92,15\.,0
93,"In the light of this evidence on record, learned counsel states that work of recording of Panchanama (Part-2) (Exh.",0
94,24) which begins at 12:30 continued up to 15:00 hours and this Panchanama does not mention that raiding party moved from residence to office.,0
95,Recovery memo Exh.,0
96,25 shows recovery of 8 notes and its recording commenced at 12:30 hours.,0
97,"Learned counsel submits that this recovery memo therefore is part of Panchanama (Part-2) and Panchanama (Part-2) is over in the office of Coal Mines Provident Fund, recovery memo at Exh.",0
98,"25, therefore, is also recorded in CMPF only and not at the residence of accused.",0
99,"He has drawn attention to cross-examination of PW-4 Birader Sinha to show that documents were seized from table of accused by CBI at about 12:30 hours and at that time CBI Inspector, witness PW-4 and Regional Commissioner Shri Verma were present.",0
100,Other Officers were also present but no outsiders was present.,0
101,"Thus, PW-2 who was working as Assistant Manager in Indian Overseas Bank or Shri Pendhari were therefore not present when second Panchanama was recorded.",0
102,"Learned counsel states that despite this, the signature of both Panch witnesses namely PW-2 Devrao Maudekar, and one Shri G.J.",0
103,Pendhari appear on Panchanama (Part-2) as also on recovery memo Exh.,0
104,25.,0
105,He therefore claims that documents at Exh.,0
106,24 & 25 needs to be discarded as they do not inspire confidence at all.,2
107,16\.,0
108,The attention of Court is invited to fact that no inventory of documents allegedly seized from table of accused has been prepared by the Judgment 7 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Investigating Officer and no such list is proved before Trial Court.,2
109,Learned counsel states that in this situation entire exercise undertaken to show that a trap was laid and has succeeded must be disbelieved.,0
110,17\.,0
111,He contends that as per version of prosecution the initial demand of bribe was of Rs.,0
112,"2,000/and it was brought down to Rs.",0

114,"However, this fact is also not proved on record.",1

118,"According to him, mere acceptance of any amount allegedly by way of illegal gratification or recovery thereof without proving demand is not sufficient to sustain the conviction.",1

123,"The complaint tendered by PW-1, was registered and the steps in investigation were taken by PW-5 Kanhaiya Sinha immediately.",0
124,"She submits that mention of time as such, in Panchanama (Part-1), or other documents including Exh.",0
125,"12 is not decisive, PW-2 Devrao Maudekar was called in CBI Office at 10:00 a.m. and this Judgment 8 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 4 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt assertion by him on oath, cannot be lost sight of.",5
126,20\.,0
127,She further submits that documents seized on record are duly exhibited as Exh.,0
128,17 to 20 and Exh.,0
129,44 to 49.,0
130,There is no challenge to these documents.,0
131,The contention that marriage had taken place in May 1996 itself has got no bearing on the controversy.,4
132,Whether advance claimed was legal or otherwise cannot be examined in this jurisdiction.,0
133,"The amount was prayed for by moving application on 2 nd May, 1996, is not in dispute and the fact that amount was not paid till the date of raid is also not in dispute.",2
134,The complaint has in the meanwhile moved applications pointing out postponement of date of marriage initially to 27.08.1996 and thereafter to 10.10.1996.,0
135,This postponement again is therefore not relevant.,0
136,She relies upon evidence of PW-7 Rajesh Visnoi to show that this witness has contacted office of CMPF in the month of November and December 1996 and then seized certain note-sheets vide Exh.,4
137,35.,0
138,She further points out that Exh.,0
139,47 - claim register and Exh.,0
140,48 - Pay Order register clearly show that appellant/accused was associated with loan case of complainant.,1
141,He cannot therefore take advantage of the fact that seizure memo has not been exhibited.,1
142,She points out that fact of seizure is brought on record sufficiently in evidence of PW-4Birader Sinha.,1
143,"However, on technical ground that Birader Sinha has not signed the document Trial Court held that he could not have proved the contents of seizure memo.",2
144,She submits that contents that seizure memo became irrelevant movement the above registers and note- sheets are exhibited during the course of evidence.,0
145,"According to her, note- sheets show delaying tactics and the documents demonstrate that though pay order/cheque was ready, it was not made over to complaint deliberately & he Judgment 9 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt got that cheque two to three days after the trap.",2
146,21\.,0
147,"According to her, the defence of total denial in such circumstances is of no assistance to accused.",0
148,The seizure of his shirt is not disputed by him specifically.,0
149,Not only this fact that amount of Rs.,2
150,"300/- was taken out from his shirt pocket, is not in dispute.",0
151,"Those notes had phenolphthalein powder and turning of solution colour to purple when hands were tested for phenolphthalein powder, is not in dispute.",0
152,She contends that hand-wash and shirt wash of shirt of accused clinch the controversy and burden shifted to accused to explain how tainted money came into his shirt pocket.,0
153,22\.,0
154,"The learned counsel states that neither Investigating Officer nor Panch had any adverse interest against the appellant, and therefore, absence of relevant entries in visit book or then mention of proper details in Panchanama, cannot enure to the benefit of accused.",0
155,She relies upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex court reported in (2007) 7 SCC 625 Girja Prasad(Dead) By LRS.,0
156,Vs. State of M.P.,3
157,23\.,0
158,During their arguments both the learned Advocates have invited my attention to various parts of depositions and also to certain precedents.,0
159,I find it convenient to referred to the same as and when occasions therefor arises in the course of this judgment.,0
160,24\.,0
161,It will be appropriate to first consider the technical objection that consent at Exh.,0
162,33 is vitiated.,0
163,Judgment of this Court in case of Nishikant Bhaskarrao Kulkani Vs. State of Maharashtra (cited supra) looks Judgment 10 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt into this aspect in paragraph 12.,5
164,"In that paragraph, judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (1997) 7 SCC 622 Mansukhlal Vitthaldas Chavhan Vs. State of Gujrat has been relied upon.",3
165,"This judgment shows that sanction cannot be granted without proper application of mind and public interest as also protection available to public servant need to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 5 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 be kept in mind.",5
166,The frivolous and vexatious prosecution needs to be avoided.,0
167,Validity of sanction therefore depends upon the material placed before sanctioning authority and consideration of all material facts and evidence by the sanctioning authority.,0
168,The order of sanction ex facie must disclosed that sanctioning authority had considered such material.,1
169,This consideration can be established in Court by producing relevant files demonstrating its consideration by sanctioning authority.,0
170,"In facts before it, this Court has observed that Municipal Council had exercised advisory jurisdiction by passing a resolution that accused No.",3
171,1 deserved to be prosecuted.,0
172,Sanctioning authority there had upheld said resolution and granted the sanction.,0
173,This Court found that material on record was in-sufficient to show proper application of mind and the authority treated grant of sanction as an idle formality.,1
174,Learned Single Judge found that it merely acted upon resolution passed by Municipal Council.,2
175,25\.,0
176,"In matter before me, the authority according sanction has entered witness box as PW-3.",0
177,The sanction order at Exh.,0

179,"12 by complainant, fact of trap, successful completion thereof, drawing of Panchanama (Part-1), accused and complainant leaving office complex and going to residential quarters, the raiding party catching accused red handed, the effect of hand-wash test and seizure of currency Judgment 11 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt notes as also shirt of accused.",1
180,"It also notices commission of an offence under Section 7 and Section 13 (1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988\.",4

182,26\.,0
183,"This authority in examination-in-chief has pointed out that it received papers, went through it, applied mind and came to the conclusion prima facie that bribe was accepted.",1
184,This authority proved sanction letter at Exh.,0
185,33.,0
186,27\.,0
187,"The cross-examination of this witnesses shows absence of reference in sanction order to papers received from its office in December 1996, absence of specific mention that complaint of complainant was perused.",2
188,Authority also accepts that designation of authority was typed with carbon.,0
189,This witness also accepts that he did not verify allegation against accused from CMPF Office and did not call from comments from said office.,0
190,He did not annex any documents with sanction letter.,0
191,The fact that draft sanction order was sent by CBI is also not mentioned in sanction order.,1
192,28\.,0
193,This cross-examination does not in any way militate with the facts mentioned in Paragraph 14 about acceptance of bribe and recovery of tainted money from the accused.,0
194,In paragraph 19 full and careful examination of material in regard to allegations against accused and of circumstances of the case is also mentioned.,1
195,"The cross-examination therefore, does not show that the process of application of mind for grant of sanction under Section 19 is not proper or there is any jurisdictional error or Judgment 12 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt perversity.",3
196,Authority granting sanction is not required to consider the probable defence at all.,0
197,The necessary documents showing involvement or connection of accused with the loan case of complainant were already produced by PW-3 Shri Das.,1
198,The error noticed by this Court in its reported judgment (cited supra) does not exist in this matter.,1
199,"Therefore, exercise of according sanction vide Exh.",0
