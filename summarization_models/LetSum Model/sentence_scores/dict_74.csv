22,"At the outset, it is required to be noted that the dispute in the present appeals is only with respect to award of statutory benefits and interest for the delayed period.",1
23,It is not in dispute that there was a huge delay of five and a half years in preferring the appeals before the High Court challenging the judgment and award passed by the Reference Court.,1
24,"However, considering the fact that in other matters the delay was condoned, the High Court condoned the delay and entertained the appeals and enhanced the amount of compensation at par with other land owners/claimants whose lands were acquired for the same project vide the same notification.",2
25,"Therefore, as such, no fault can be found with the order passed by the High Court condoning the delay.",1

29,"In the case of Dhiraj Singh (supra), while condoning the delay in preferring the appeal before this Court, while enhancing the amount of compensation at par with other similarly situated land owners, this Court has denied the interest on the enhanced amount of compensation for the period of delay in approaching the High Court by way of LPAs.",5
30,"Similar view is expressed by this Court in the case of K. Subbarayudu (supra) and while condoning the delay in preferring the appeal, this Court has denied the interest for the period of delay.",3
31,"Merely because at the time of condoning the delay no such condition was imposed that the claimants shall not be entitled to the interest on the enhanced amount of compensation for the period of delay, the appellant who is otherwise a public body cannot be saddled with the liability to pay the interest for the period of delay, which is not at all attributed to them.",3
32,"Under the circumstances, the common impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court awarding the interest on the enhanced amount of compensation for the period of delay in preferring the 5 appeals deserve to be quashed and set aside and the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court is required to be modified to the aforesaid extent.",5
