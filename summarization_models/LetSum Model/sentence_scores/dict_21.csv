53,"5 and 6 in the aforesaid revision application, preferred this Writ Petition.",0
54,2\.,0
55,Brief facts giving rise to the present Writ Petition are as follows: a.,0
56,The suit property involved in the present matter is land Gat no.,1
57,15 (original survey nos.,0
58,"7 to 15), situated at village Kauthe Malkapur, Taluka Sangamner, District Ahmednagar and it is Hadola Watan land.",0
59,"Though the matter concerns with the permission to convert the suit property into non-agricultural use, certain facts, as pleaded by both the parties, are required to be mentioned.",0
60,b.,0
61,"The State Government has abolished the Watan lands as per the provisions of the Bombay Inferior Village Watans Abolition Act, 1958 (for short, ""the Act of 1958"").",6
62,The petitioners claim to be the heirs and legal representatives of the original watandar Shri Samba WP-8788-15pd Mohanna Bagul and co-owner of the land Gat no.,1
63,"15, which is re- granted by the State Government.",2
64,"Thus, the petitioners claim to be the interested parties in land Gat nos.",0
65,"15/9, 15/10 and 15/17 which is disputed in the present writ petition.",0
66,The petitioners have already filed Special Civil Suit No.,3
67,"27 of 2013 in the Court of learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Sangamner claiming partition in the suit property and challenging the sale deeds executed in favour of Shri Ravindra Birole, Shri Shantanu Birole and Smt.",4
68,Ashwini Birole in the said civil suit.,1
69,Petitioners claim that their valuable rights are included in the suit property and hence the petitioners have filed the above mentioned suit for partition by metes and bounds.,1
70,The said Ravindra Birole and two others filed an application under Section 9-A of the Civil Procedure Code and a separate application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code contending that Special Civil Suit No.,7
71,27 of 2013 is not maintainable.,2
72,"Both the applications were heard on merits and the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Sangamner, by order dated 24.04.2015 held that the Civil Court has jurisdiction to entertain the said suit so also the issue of limitation is a mixed question of facts and hence the suit itself is maintainable.",5
73,"Against the said order dated 24.04.2015, Shri Ravindra Birole and two others filed Civil Revision Application No.",4
74,56 of 2015 before this Court and after hearing both the sides this Court by order dated 27.07.2015 specifically held that the suit filed by the present petitioners along WP-8788-15pd with others in the Civil Court is very well maintainable.,7
75,"The said suit is still pending before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Sangamner.",1
76,"c. According to the petitioners, though the said Mahar Watan Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168431808/ 3 Rajendra Sambhaji Bagul And ... vs The Divisional Commissioner, ... on 20 June, 2019 land was abolished in the year 1965 by the State Government, thereafter, the State Government has decided to re-grant the lands in favour of the original watandars, who were in actual possession of the said watan properties.",9
77,"According to the petitioners, though there were no re-grant orders, some of the watandars illegally sold portion of Gat no.",1
78,15 and tried to effect mutation entry nos.,0
79,850 and 851\.,0
80,It is the case of the petitioners that even prior to the re-grant of land gat no.,2
81,"15 to the original owners, it appears from the record that Arjun Bagul, Thaka Bagul, Dhana Bagul, Govind Laxman Bagul, so also Yeshu Arjuna Bagul and Laxman Muka Bagul illegally sold part of land gat no.",1
82,15 (old survey no.8) on 22.09.1966 prior to re-grant of which mutation entry nos.,0
83,850 and 851 were taken.,0
84,"However, the said mutation entries came to be rejected by the concerned Tahsildar on the ground that the land itself was not re-granted.",1
85,"However, according to the petitioners, one Mr. Ravindra Birole claims that the re-grant order was passed in favour of Yeshu Arjuna, Thaka Bagul alongwith 10 others by re-grant order no.137 of 1969 as Najrana was paid on 01.04.1965.",3
86,It is tried to be shown by said Ravindra Birole that the mutation entry of the said re- grant order was taken on record WP-8788-15pd and the mutation entry nos.,0
87,928 and 929 came to be sanctioned by the Tahsildar on 11.02.1970.,0
88,"The petitioners further claim that said Ravindra Birole and his family members had purchased land from Gat nos.15/9, 15/10 and 15/17 admeasuring 30 R. under registered sale deed Nos.9922/2012, 6477/2012 and 4792/2012 without permission of the competent authority.",0
89,"According to the petitioners, in view of the amended provisions of the Act of 1958, permission to execute sale deeds of Hadola Watan land is necessary.",3
90,"So far as the mutation entries 456, 457 and 458 in respect of some portion of the land Gat no.",1
91,"15 manipulated by earlier vendor of Mr. Ravindra Birole, namely, Vitthal Laxman Sagar in collusion with the Revenue authorities, one Vijay Jangu Bagul made a complaint to the concerned Sub-Divisional Officer bringing to his notice that even prior to re-grant, the sale deeds came to be executed in respect of the land Gat no.",2
92,"15 by some persons and though the earlier mutation entries came to be rejected, yet mutation entry nos.",0
93,"456, 457 and 458 were fraudulently taken.",0
94,The Sub- Divisional Officer initiated suo motu revenue proceedings against the said mutation entry nos.,0
95,"456, 457 and 458 respectively.",0
96,Said Ravindra Birole filed Writ Petition No.7513 of 2013 before this Court and this Court granted status quo in the matter which continued from time to time.,4
97,"WP-8788-15pd d. According to the petitioners, though Ravindra Birole claims to have purchased the land out of land Gat no.",1
98,"15 for agricultural purposes, later on in the year 2012-13, he has established a company, namely, U-Tech Sugar Limited (respondent no.6 herein).",1
99,"Thereafter, said Ravindra Birole has applied to the Sub-Divisional Officer for granting NA permission for conversion of use of the land for the said sugar industry.",0
100,"Respondent no.6 has applied under Section 44(1) of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 (for short, "" the MLR Code"") for non-agricultural permission of the land in Gat no.",6
101,"15/9 ad-measuring 3 H. 95 R, old Gat no.",1
102,"15/10 ad- measuring 3 H. 55 R., old Gat no.",1

104,15/3.,0
105,"After receipt of the said proposal seeking permission for conversion of the use of agricultural land into non-agricultural land in respect of the property as detailed above, the Sub-Divisional Officer, Sangamner has forwarded copy of the said proposal on 08.02.2013 to the Town Planning Department for necessary action and accordingly, the inquiry has begun.",0
106,"The Assistant Director of Town Planning has sanctioned only a part NA layout plan on certain condition by order dated 14.03.2013 and it has been observed in the said sanction order that some area of the said land comes under forest division, where development is not permitted.",2
107,"The said portion of the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168431808/ 4 Rajendra Sambhaji Bagul And ... vs The Divisional Commissioner, ... on 20 June, 2019 land was excluded from development plan.",4
108,"Further, said WP-8788-15pd Ravindra Birole was directed to submit the NOC of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.",0
109,"e. It is further case of the petitioners that thereafter, on 15.04.2013, the Sub- Divisional Officer directed respondent no.4 Tahsildar Sangamner to comply with the order dated 14.03.2013 and even said Ravindra Birole was also informed to comply with the deficiencies as pointed out in the letter/order dated 14.03.2013.",2
110,"Thereafter, respondent no.4 Tahsildar has directed the Circle Officer, Sakur, Taluka Sangamner to ascertain whether there is any complaint in respect of the ownership right of said Ravindra Birole.",0
111,"The Sub- Divisional Officer, Sangamner, by order dated 07.05.2013, rejected the proposal for NA permission as the compliance as directed was not made in time.",2
112,"On 07.08.2013, for the first time, the NOC issued by the Pollution Control Board was produced on record by Ravindra Birole.",0
113,"As against the order dated 07.05.2013 rejecting the proposal of NA permission, said Ravindra Birole had filed Writ Petition No.",3

115,"However, the said Writ Petition was disposed of by this Court with liberty to the said Ravindra Birole to adopt the remedy of appeal.",2
116,Said Ravindra Birole had filed appeal no.,4
117,"49 of 2013 before the Divisional Commissioner, Nashik challenging the order dated 07.05.2013 passed by the Sub- Divisional Officer rejecting his proposal seeking NA permission.",4
118,"The present petitioners had filed an WP-8788-15pd application for intervention in the said appeal and the Additional Commissioner, Nashik allowed the said application.",4
119,"Thereafter, the petitioners had filed a detailed reply bringing to the notice of the Additional Commissioner their valuable rights in respect of the said property.",3
120,"By order dated 27.01.2014, the learned Additional Commissioner has partly allowed the appeal of Mr. Ravindra Birole and remanded the matter to the Sub-Divisional Officer to reconsider and verify the point nos.",3
121,"1 to 4, as formulated in the order and further directed the Sub-Divisional Officer to verify whether hissas and pot- hissas as mentioned in the 7/12 extract are in consonance with the hissas (shares) as appearing in the measurement map.",0
122,The learned Additional Commissioner has also directed the Sub-Divisional Officer to decide the matter afresh on its merits.,0
123,"f. According to the petitioners, on 18.03.2014, said Ravindra Birole alongwith respondent no.6 herein, for the first time have filed Writ Petition No.",2
124,2659 of 2014 before this Court challenging the order dated 27.01.2014 instead of filing an appeal.,5
125,The said Writ Petition No.2659 of 2014 and the earlier Writ Petition No.,3
126,7513 of 2013 remained pending for many days.,2
127,"According to the petitioners, after the Assembly elections held in the month October, 2014, when the BJP party came into power, said Ravindra Birole has illegally and malafidely withdrawn the aforesaid Writ Petitions though opposed by WP-8788-15pd the present petitioners and before that, during pendency of the Writ Petitions, respondent no.6 herein, who was not a party in that capacity before the Commissioner, has illegally and malafidely preferred Revision before respondent no.5 directly.",0
128,"According to the petitioners, the hearing was scheduled before the Minister on 16.04.2015 and the petitioners had appeared before the Hon'ble Minister through an Advocate and sought adjournment and accordingly, next date was given on 23.04.2015.",0
129,"Even though the petitioners have specifically requested for supply of copies of the documents, no documents, annexed to the revision application, were supplied to the petitioners and they were directed to file reply within one week.",1
130,"Thereafter, the Hon'ble Minister without actually hearing the matter on merits, closed the said matter for orders directly.",0
131,"On 13.05.2015, respondent No.5 Hon'ble Minister has passed the impugned order and it was never intimated to the present petitioners as required under law.",1
132,"The Hon'ble Minister by Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168431808/ 5 Rajendra Sambhaji Bagul And ... vs The Divisional Commissioner, ... on 20 June, 2019 impugned order dated 13.05.2015, has allowed the revision application filed by respondent no.6 herein, set aside the order dated 27.01.2014 passed by the Additional Commissioner and further directed the Sub- Divisional Officer, Sangamner to grant NA permission for industrial use as per the discussion made in the body of the order.",10
133,The Hon'ble Minister has further stated that the decision given by him is subject to the outcome of the pending civil suit.,5
134,"Hence, this Writ Petition.",0
135,WP-8788-15pd 3\.,0
136,"The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that the impugned order dated 13.05.2015, on the face of it, is illegal and arbitrary for the reasons that the same is cryptic and unreasoned order and the same is passed without deciding the contentions raised by the present petitioners.",2
137,"Even though the petitioners have requested for oral hearing, the same came to be denied arbitrarily.",0
138,Learned senior counsel submits that the contentions raised by the petitioners in their written arguments were not at all considered by respondent no.5/Hon'ble Minister.,1
139,The petitioners were only supplied the copy of the revision application but the documents annexed to the revision application were never supplied to the petitioners.,1
140,"Though it was specifically brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Minister, yet the documents were not supplied.",2
141,"Hence, the impugned order itself is in violation of the principles of natural justice.",0
142,The learned senior counsel submits that the order of the Additional Commissioner dated 27.01.2014 came to be challenged before the Hon'ble Minister in the Revision filed on 13.03.2015.,2
143,"Though there is delay of more than one year, yet no application seeking condonation of delay came to be filed.",1
144,The Hon'ble Minister has decided the said revision on merits without condoning the delay.,0
145,The learned senior counsel submits that respondent no.6 has deliberately not filed the statutory second appeal against the order dated 27.01.2014 passed by the Additional WP-8788-15pd Commissioner and preferred the revision before the Minister on 13.03.2015.,4
146,"The learned senior counsel submits that it is the part of record that the Hon'ble Minister, within a period of seven days, has heard and allowed the said revision petition.",3
147,Learned senior counsel submits that the revision itself is not maintainable before respondent no.5/Hon'ble Minister since the matter was remanded by the Commissioner directing the Sub-Divisional Officer to make an inquiry into the matter on certain points as formulated in the order.,0
148,"Thus, the revision before the Hon'ble Minister is premature and the same could not have been entertained.",0
149,"Though the remedy of statutory second appeal is available under the MLR Code, the exercise of revisional powers was totally unwarranted and uncalled for and the same has been done with the sole intention to favour respondent no.6.",3
150,"Learned counsel submits that the so-called sale deeds executed in favour of Ravindra Birole are itself hit by the provisions of the Act of 1958 and hence at any rate, the NA permission could not have been granted as the sale deeds in favour of Ravindra Birole and the U-Tech Sugar Limited are itself void ab initio.",4
151,The Hon'ble Minister has not considered the effect of the amendments of the years 2002 and 2008 in the Act of 1958.,8
152,There is no provision in the amended Act of 1958 to pay 13 times Najrana to convert new tenure land into old tenure land.,5
153,Learned senior counsel submits that the petitioners are the co- owners of the land Gat no.,1
154,15.,0
155,"So far as the sale deeds executed in WP-8788-15pd favour of Ravindra Birole are concerned, the persons, who have got no absolute title, have executed the said sale deeds.",0
156,All the sale deeds are the subject matter of challenge in special civil suit no.,2
157,27 of 2013 before the civil court.,3
158,Learned senior counsel submits that land Gat no.,1
159,"15 comprises the huge portion of land admeasuring 92.59 H. The said land was allotted to eight families towards the inferior watan which is not partitioned by metes and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168431808/ 6 Rajendra Sambhaji Bagul And ... vs The Divisional Commissioner, ... on 20 June, 2019 bounds and the shares of persons are yet not fixed.",4
160,There is no measurement map prepared by issuing notice to all the land holders and adjacent land holders.,1
161,Respondent no.6 has sought NA permission of the part of land Gat no.,2
162,15 without making any actual measurement.,0
163,"Learned senior counsel submits that there is no deemed NA permission and on a simple application without compliance of any statutory rules, the permission for NA use cannot be granted.",0
164,"Said Ravindra Birole has applied for NA permission on 07.02.2013 wherein the statutory authority has directed him for various compliance by orders dated 14.03.2013, 28.03.2013 and 15.04.2013 respectively.",1
165,"Thus, the submission of the said respondent no.6 about expiry of 90 days and the deemed NA permission is irrelevant and cannot be made applicable to the facts of the present case.",1
166,The learned senior counsel submits that the suit lands were never transferred to U-Tech Sugar Limited/respondent no.6 under the registered documents.,0
167,"On 07.02.2013, the said Ravindra Birole and Ashwini Birole have applied WP-8788-15pd for NA permission under Section 44-A of the MLR Code and it nowhere discloses that the said permission is sought for respondent no.6 herein.",4
168,There is no document for transfer of property from Ravindra Birole and said Ashwini Birole to respondent no.6 herein.,0
169,"Thus, respondent no.6 had never applied for NA use of the suit land.",0
170,"The learned senior counsel submits that there are valid questions raised before the authorities below regarding (a) inquiry of title, (b) compliance of rules and regulations of the Regional Planning, (c) compliance of pollution control, (d) proper measurement plan and location co- related to record of right, (e) verification of the record of T.I.L.R., (f) objection of the original owner with respect to rights under the provisions of the Act of 1958.",4

447,"6 company, namely, U-Tech Sugar Limited.",0
448,It is the settled law that the benefit of agreements entered into by the promoters can very well be passed on to the company.,1
449,"Even Sub-section (1) of Section 44 of MLR Code, 1966 permits an occupant of alienated land or superior holder of alienated land or a tenant of such land to apply for NA use of land.",4

451,"Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that the second objection is raised that second appeal was maintainable in the present matter and bypassing the said statutory remedy, revision is filed without any application for condonation of delay.",3
452,"In this connection, it is necessary to point out that the order under section 44 of the MLR Code has to be passed by the Collector.",3
453,Even if the order in the present matter is passed by the S.D.O.,1
454,"as a delegate of the Collector, it cannot be said that the said officer was not the Revenue Officer as contemplated under item III of Schedule -E of Section 247 of the M.L.R.",3
455,"Code, and therefore, the appeal against any such order was to be filed before the Divisional Commissioner and further appeal is not provided against the order of Commissioner and only revision is the appropriate remedy under Section 257 of the WP-8788-15pd M.L.R.",7
456,Code and the same is availed by respondent no.6.,0
457,The application for conversion of the land to non agriculture use was moved before the S.D.O.,0
458,on 07.02.2013.,0
459,An inquiry was conducted by the Assistant Director of Town Planning and conditional recommendations were issued and said conditions were fulfilled by respondent No.,1
460,"6 and consequently it was the case of deemed grant, as contemplated under section 44(3) of the MLR Code, upon expiry of the period of 90 days, for want of communication of any decision of rejection.",4
461,"It is the matter of record that in the absolute suspicious manner, respondent No.3 is coming up with the case of passing the order of rejection of application of respondent No.6 which is apparently ante- dated, so as to deprive respondent No.6 from the benefits of deemed permission.",1
462,Respondent No.,1

484,"Code, appeal lies to the State Government in respect of the original order passed by the Commissioner etc., there was no other remedy available to the respondent except to file revision before the State Government to invoke the powers under Section 257 of the Code.",7
485,There is no prescribed period of limitation to file WP-8788-15pd revision under Section 257.,4
486,The said revision was admittedly filed on 13/17.03.2015 i.e.,1
487,"hardly after a year of passing of the order by the appellate authority and for the said intervening time, the writ petition was pending and therefore there was no impediment in entertaining the said revision.",0

489,Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that the petitioners are coming up with the case that the order was passed by the revisional authority (respondent no.5- Hon'ble Minister) in haste and without giving proper opportunity of hearing.,3
490,The said claim is absolutely incorrect and improper inasmuch as it is a matter of record that not only the oral arguments were advanced before the revisional authority on 16.04.2015 but written notes of arguments were also filed by the petitioners on 23.04.2015.,1
491,It can also be gathered from the impugned order that each and every argument of petitioners is reordered and considered.,1

494,"Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that, as it appears from the order passed in the revision, respondent No.6 was directed to deposit 50% amount of market value of the land as Najrana being old condition, i.e.",4

496,"23,94,943/- for getting the required permission of non agriculture use, which the WP-8788-15pd respondent No.",1

498,36\.,0
499,"Learned counsel for respondent No.6 submits that in so far as the scope of interference is concerned, it is settled law that exercise of writ jurisdiction is discretionary in nature and this Court while exercising the said power cannot convert itself as court of appeal.",4
