50,"This communication is replied to by the Commissioner of Police, Central Region, Mumbai and that authority has mentioned that as statement of witnesses supported the complaint of Respondent No.2, police officers were duty bound to take cognizance and there was nothing wrong with it.",0
51,In this communication the records pertaining to telephone call made by the Applicant to Anti Corruption Bureau also find mention and it is expressed that this fact could have been noted by police had they questioned Applicant before his arrest.,1

65,"When Anti Corruption Bureau was approached with a grievance and Applicant contended that papers were taken from him outside the office of Charity Commissioner in order to pacify him not to complaint to Anti Corruption Bureau, the investigating officer should have examined correctness of contention in complaint that matter was scheduled for hearing on 28.06.2006 and after hearing Applicant therein, an order was passed.",4
66,The matter presented by Applicant would have been registered and had some case number and would have appeared on daily board.,1
