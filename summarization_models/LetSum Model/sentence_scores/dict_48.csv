91,when the said assault took place.,0
92,"He has admitted that, therefore, they were not in a position to see who were assaulting deceased- Yogesh.",0

94,"Ramesh Warghade (PW1), Harishchandra Warghade (PW2) and Sunil M.

95,"At that time, deceased- Yogesh told him that, Santosh is not in the house.",0
96,"However, accused No.1- Kiran Baderao saw Santosh in the house and, therefore, he abused Yogesh in a filthy language and questioned Yogesh as to why he SSKN 8/12 871.12-apeal--judgment.doc spoke lie though Santosh was in house.",0
97,"Accused No.1- Kiran Baderao, therefore, asked Santosh Yashwantrao to come out of house and, therefore, all the witnesses came out of the house.",0
98,The said witness saw all the accused Nos.1 to 6 standing outside the house.,0
99,"That, accused No.1- Kiran Baderao, accused No.2- Mahendra Deshmukh, accused No.3- Rohan Deshmukh were holding swords and accused No.4- Dashrath Baderao, accused No.5- Ajay Deshmukh and accused No.6 Eknath Baderao were holding wooden rods in their hands.",0

102,They have stated that the incident of assault on Yogesh took place on account of land transactions.,3
103,7\.,0
104,"It is to be noted here that Harishchandra Warghade (PW2) in his testimony has stated that the accused No.2- Mahendra Deshmukh gave a blow of sword on his right hand and, therefore, he became unconscious.",3
105,He was not aware as to who took him to the Government Hospital.,1
106,He regained consciousness on 3rd August 2008 and the Police thereafter recorded his statement on 4 th August 2008 in Janjira Hospital.,3
107,"Dr.Vinay Devlalkar (PW7), in his testimony, has contradicted the testimony of SSKN 9/12 871.12-apeal--judgment.doc Harishchandra Warghade (PW2) and has stated that Harishchandra (PW2) was brought by 4 to 5 persons in a vehicle on 1 st August 2008 at about 6.40 pm to the hospital and Harishchandra himself gave history of assault on him by two to four persons.",5
108,"Thus, the version of Harishchandra (PW2) that he got unconscious after receiving blow of sword and regained consciousness on 3rd August 2008 appears to be not a true version in his testimony.",3
109,"It appears that the said witness is not telling truth and, therefore, the said witness is not a reliable witness.",1
110,8\.,0
111,"As far as testimony of Sunil M. Warghade (PW10) is concerned, the same is consistent with the prosecution case but it is contrary to the version narrated by Mustaq Shaikh (PW3).",1
112,"It is to be noted here that Ramesh Warghade (PW1), Harishchandra Warghade (PW2) and Sunil M. Warghade (PW10) are close relatives of deceased- Yogesh.",0
113,It is Mustaq Shaikh (PW3) who is an independent eye witness though he was close friend of deceased- Yogesh.,0
114,"As noted earlier, in the cross-examination of Mustaq Shaikh, vital admissions have been brought on record by the defence which, in our view, really go to the root of the matter.",0
115,His version is that mob of hundred persons started assaulting them including the deceased.,0
116,"Therefore, he started running away.",0
117,Mustaq Shaikh (PW3) has fairly admitted that he did not see the actual SSKN 10/12 871.12-apeal--judgment.doc assault and he along with other eye witnesses ran away from the scene of offence immediately after the assault started.,0
118,9\.,0
119,"At this stage, it is important to note that though the entire incident has taken place in or near about house of Santosh Yashwantrao, he has not been examined by the prosecution.",0
120,"Manohar Patil Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85708026/ 4 Mahendra Dattatraya Deshmukh And ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 28 February, 2019 (PW11) the investigating officer, in his cross-examination, has admitted that, he had recorded statement of Santosh Yashwantrao and had also requested the learned Magistrate to record his statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.",9
121,"That, accordingly, the learned Magistrate had recorded the statement of Santosh Yashwantrao and witness Vishnu Thakare.",0
122,"According to us, Santosh Yashwantrao was a star witness in the present case in whose house or in the precincts of his house the entire incident took place.",1
123,"According to the prosecution case, he is the said person to whom Yogesh (deceased) tried to shield by telling lie for which accused No.1- Kiran got angry and assaulted Yogesh.",0
124,"Non- examination of such important witness, namely, Santosh Yashwantrao by the prosecution creates a serious doubt in the mind of this Court about the veracity of the statements of other eye witnesses, namely, Ramesh Warghade (PW1), Harishchandra Warghade (PW2) and Sunil Murlidhar Warghade (PW10) though the said witnesses are injured eye witnesses.",1
125,SSKN 11/12 871.12-apeal--judgment.doc This observation is made in reference to the testimony of Mustaq Shaikh (PW3) who has deposed a totally different version than the other three eye witnesses who are undoubtedly close relatives of the deceased- Yogesh.,0
126,There are two different versions available on record.,0
127,It is the well settled principle of law that a version or circumstance which is beneficial or favourable to the accused needs to be taken into consideration by the Court while appreciating evidence on record.,1
128,"As noted earlier, Mustaq Shaikh (PW3) is an independent eye witness.",0
129,His version inspires confidence in the minds of this Court.,2
130,This witness is wholly reliable and trustworthy.,0
