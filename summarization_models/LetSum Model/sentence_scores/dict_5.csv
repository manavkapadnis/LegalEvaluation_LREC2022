147,"Although one need not attach much importance to the extra-judicial confession made by the appellant in the instant case, especially in view of the cogent and convincing eye-witness account presented by PW 10, nevertheless, PW 3 did depose about the appellant making an extra-judicial confession about his guilt immediately after the occurrence.",1
148,PWs 5 and 6 too alluded to a similar tenor in the threats meted out by the appellant.,1
149,Seizure of offending bricks: 12\.,0
150,The seizure of the bricks from the appellant immediately after the occurrence further points towards his guilt.,1
151,"Although PW 7, a seizure list witness turned hostile and stated that nothing was seized in his presence, he admitted his signature on the seizure list.",2
152,"But, PW 1 clearly proved the seizure.",0
153,Medical evidence: 13\.,0
154,"PW 9, the post-mortem doctor, inter alia, stated as under:""On that day I held the post-mortem of Aparajita alias Piou Mondal.",1
155,The dead body was identified by C. 1169 Sarupa Nanda Ghosh to me.,0
156,The victim was 11 years old on that day.,0
157,"I found lacerated injury on whole of scalp, multiple fracture on skull bone.",0
158,"Lacerated injury of bone, cerebral haemorrhage, extradural haemorrhage, subdural haemorrahage, sub- arachnotic.",0
159,This is the post-mortem report of the dead body of Aparajita Mondal which is duly prepared and signed by me.,0
160,(Mark the post-mortem report of the dead body of Aparajita Mondal as Ext.,0
161,4).,0
162,In my opinion the death was due to injuries mentioned in my report and it is ante-mortem and homicidal in nature.,0
163,If one is assaulted by a heavy brick one might sustain such type of injury and it may even cause his/her death.,1
164,"On that day I also held the post-mortem of Jayanti Mondal, 30 years identified by C/1169 Sarupa Nanda Ghosh.",0
165,"On examination I found lacerated injury of scalp, multiple fracture of skull, lacerated injury of bone, cerebral haemorrhage, extradural haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, subarachnotic haemorrhage.",0
166,The post-mortem report of Jayanti Mondal is duly prepared and signed by me.,0

169,In my opinion death was due to injuries mentioned in my report.,0
170,It s ante-mortem and homicidal in nature.,0
171,"If one is hit by brick one might sustain such type of injuries and even instantly cause death.""",0
172,"Therefore, the medical evidence as presented by PW 9 fully corroborated the ocular evidence as adduced by PW 10.",0
173,Whether murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder: 14\.,0
174,"The main submission on behalf of the appellant was that the conviction under Section 302 could be scaled down to one under Section 304, Part I of the Penal Code.",4
175,"Afterall, it has come in evidence that prior to the incident, there was a quarrel between the husband and the wife.",0
176,"But, a murder need not always be a premeditated one.",0
177,It is settled law that intention to commit murder can develop instantaneously.,0
178,"Therefore, it is necessary to analyse whether there was anything on record to show that the offence could have been a culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",0
179,"Although the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46753019/ 5 Mathur @ Mathura Mondal vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 July, 2019 preceding quarrel in a way acted as a mitigating factor, there were too many aggravating circumstances to deal with.",5
180,"First, the appellant did not assault the victims with hand, but choose to hit them with bricks.",1
181,Even those bricks were not easily available.,0
182,One after the other those were taken out from the leg of a cot in order that those may be used to assault the victims.,1
183,A sudden rage would have ended by such time.,0
184,But the appellant spent enough time and gave sufficient effort to take out those bricks from the leg of the cot and thereafter assaulted the victims on vital parts of their bodies.,1
185,"One would have given a second thought, if at all, the appellant had struck the first victim with a brick and stopped at that.",1
186,"But, he did not stop there.",0
187,"The appellant was having no quarrel with the second victim, her daughter.",1
188,"Simply because she intervened, the appellant choose to hit her on a vital part of her body with another brick.",1
189,"In such circumstances, one cannot give a benefit of doubt to the appellant that he might not have had the intention to murder his wife and child in the present case.",2
190,The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State rightly distinguished the decisions relied on by the Learned Counsel for the appellant on facts.,3
191,The case at hand is quite different.,1
192,"Here two murders were committed, one after the other and the sequence of events do not permit giving any benefit of doubt to the appellant even on the question of scaling it down to Section 304, Part I of the Penal Code.",5
193,15\.,0
194,"In view of the convincing eye-witness account, the supportive medical evidence and the corroborative post-occurrence accounts, we hold that the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts.",1
195,16\.,0
196,"In view of the above, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the judgment and order of conviction and sentence.",2
197,17\.,0
198,"Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the State would consider any remission in favour of appellant is a different issue.",2
199,We refrain from making any observation in this regard.,0
200,18\.,0
201,A copy of the judgment along with the Lower Court records shall be sent down to the learned Trial Court forthwith by a Special Messenger for information and necessary action.,1
