91,The mutation on the basis of aforesaid sale deed was taken in revenue record on 15.8.1946 and it is not disputed that on the basis of aforesaid sale deed the predecessors of the appellants (hereinafter referred to as 'purchasers') have been in possession of the aforesaid both the lands.,4
92,"4) The Bombay Paragana and Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' for short) came in force on 1.5.1951.",3

97,"Ramchandra, vendor died in the year 1962 and during his lifetime, he did not raise objection to aforesaid revenue entries and orders made in favour of the purchaser.",3
98,"5) First time in the year 1976 the successors of holder, respondent Nos.",3
99,"8 to 10, vendors filed appeal before Sub Divisional Officer (hereinafter referred to as 'S.D.O.'",4
100,for short) to challenge the aforesaid order made in the year 1956 in favour of purchaser under the Act.,4
101,This appeal was dismissed by the S.D.O.,2
102,by decision dated 25.8.1977.,1
103,The decision of S.D.O.,0
104,was challenged by respondent Nos.,0
105,8 to 10 before Additional Collector and by order dated 7.9.1979 Additional Collector allowed this proceeding and remanded the matter to Tahsildar for fresh inquiry.,2
106,"The decision of the Collector was challenged before Additional Commissioner in revision by the purchaser, but the revision was dismissed and the proceeding which was filed before the Government to challenge the order was also dismissed.",4
107,6) On 15.10.1984 the Tahsildar made order of regrant in favour of respondent Nos.,0
108,8 to 10.,0
109,This order was confirmed by the LPA No.,1

118,701/2003 was then filed by the purchaser before the learned Single Judge.,2
119,"Without passing reasoned order, the review application came to be rejected.",1
120,Against the decision of Review Application No.,1
121,"701/2003, Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.",1

123,The Apex Court allowed both the S.L.Ps.,1
124,and directed the learned Single Judge to decide few legal points which were pointed out by the Division Bench in L.P.A.,3
125,No.,1
126,55/2002 and learned Single Judge was expected to decide those points in Review Application No.,2
127,701/2003.,0
128,This time by passing reasoned order the learned Single Judge again dismissed the Review Application No.,3
129,701/2003 and this decision is under challenge in the present appeal.,1
130,"Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141130310/ 5 Keshavrao Tulshiram Patil Since ... vs State Of Maha & Ors on 10 January, 2019 7) Few undisputed and relevant points need to be quoted first in the present proceeding for better appreciation of both the factual and legal position and they are as under :LPA No.",8
131,"10/2004 (I) It is not disputed that the consideration of Rs.13,000/- was received by Ramchandra when aforesaid two properties were sold by Ramchandra.",0
132,The sale deed was executed for himself and for the minor sons of brother of Ramchandra as guardian of those minors.,0
133,It is also not disputed that the possession of both the lands was given to purchaser under sale deed by vendor.,0
134,The legal necessity is mentioned in the sale deed.,0
135,(II) It is not disputed that both the lands were Kulkarni Watan properties.,0
136,"It is also not disputed that Ramchandra, vendor had applied for permission to sell the two lands, but the permission of sale was refused and it was informed by the authority that it was open to Ramchandra to alienate 'life interest'.",0
137,"(III) It is not disputed that on the basis of sale deed of 1944 mutation was made in revenue record in favour of purchaser and purchaser was shown as owner of the property and in possession column also, the name of purchaser was entered.",5
138,The name of Watandar was deleted.,0
139,(IV) It is not disputed that again after coming in to force of the Act the names of holder of Watan were entered in the revenue LPA No.,2
140,10/2004 record and the name of purchaser was shown in other right's column and that happened in the year 1953.,3
141,"However, it is not disputed that the possession continued with purchaser.",0
142,(V) It is not disputed that in the year 1956 the purchaser applied under the Act for regrant of lands to him and order was made in his favour on 1.6.1956.,4
143,"It is not disputed that vendor Ramchandra was alive when this order was made, but he did not take objection to the order of regrant made in favour of the purchaser.",0
144,"The sons of deceased brother of Ramchandra had attained majority at the relevant time, but they also did not take objection to the order of regrant.",0
145,"The regrant was on new impartiable... tenure, occupant class II.",0
146,"It is not disputed that Nazarana amount equal to six times of total revenue was paid on 30.4.1956 in respect of both the lands by the purchaser and the name of purchaser was entered as owner, occupant on 13.10.1957 and the names of holders of Watan which were entered in the year 1953 were again deleted from revenue record and this mutation was sanctioned on 13.7.1958.",4
147,These mutations were never challenged by vendor or his successors.,0
148,"(VI) It is not disputed that Ramchandra, vendor died in the year 1962.",3
149,It is also not disputed that Kabulayat about the LPA No.,1
150,"10/2004 conditions of regrant was obtained from purchaser by revenue authority and they continued to enjoy the property as owner, but no steps were taken by the successors of holder to get back both the lands.",0
151,First time in the year 1976 respondent No.,4
152,8 Dinanath who was also shown as one of the vendors challenged the regrant made in favour of the purchaser in the year 1956 by filing Watan Appeal No.,6
153,24/1974.,0
154,The order of dismissal of the appeal by S.D.O.,2
155,"is on record and it shows that following points were raised by the purchaser to contest the appeal :(a) Ramchandra, vendor had knowledge of regrant, but he had not challenged the order of regrant, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141130310/ 6 Keshavrao Tulshiram Patil Since ... vs State Of Maha & Ors on 10 January, 2019 (b) Appellant Dinanath had no interest left in the disputed lands and he had no locus standi to file the appeal, and (c) There was no provision in law to condone such long delay which was of about 20 years as per the date of regrant and the proceeding was not in limitation.",10
156,(VII) The learned S.D.O.,0
157,dismissed Watan Appeal No.,4
158,24/1976 on merits and also by holding that the proceeding was not filed within limitation.,1
159,(VIII) Dinanath filed another appeal before Superior Officer like LPA No.,4
160,"10/2004 Additional Collector and the appeal came to be allowed by giving following reasons :(a) That, the first appellate authority and also in original regrant proceeding it was not considered as to whether the purchaser was entitled to get the regrant when from the year 1953 onwards the name of purchaser was not shown in occupancy column (it was there in other right's column and they were in actual possession).",5
161,"(b) That, probably no notice of proceeding filed by purchaser was issued to holder of Watan.",3
162,"(c) That, it was necessary for the authority to inquire whether the transfer of land in favour of purchaser was permissible and (c) That, the appellant Dinanath and other successors of Ramchandra had revertionary rights and the rights had accrued after the death of Ramchandra and so, fresh inquiry on this point was necessary by Tahsildar.",1
163,"(IX) Though the aforesaid reasons were given by Additional Collector in the decision dated 7.9.1979, the operative order of remand was of following nature :""O R D E R The appeal is allowed.",5

179,This order shows that the order of the original authority of regrant was not set aside.,3
180,"(X) The order of learned Additional Collector made on 7.9.1979 does not show that the point of limitation which was considered by S.D.O., the first appellate authority as it was raised was considered and decided by the learned Additional Collector.",1
181,"The point of limitation was raised in respect of maintainability of appeal itself that it was time barred and so, the point of tenability of such appeal when there was no application filed for condonation of delay was also required to be considered, but that was not considered by learned Additional Collector.",3
182,The order of learned Additional Collector LPA No.,1
183,10/2004 does not show that he had condoned the delay caused in filing the appeal against the order of regrant made in favour of the purchaser.,1
184,(XI) The aforesaid order of learned Additional Collector dated 7.9.1979 was challenged in revision by purchaser first by filing the proceeding before the learned Additional Commissioner and then before the Government.,2
185,Both the authorities held that the order of remand was proper and the last proceeding came to be dismissed on 14.9.1981.,2
186,The point of limitation was not touched by both these authorities.,0
187,The decision was not further challenged by purchaser and then the inquiry was made by the Tahsildar.,1
188,(XII) The order made by Tahsildar after remand dated 15.10.1984 shows that Tahsildar used only observations made by the appellate revenue authority and revisional authority and the reasoning given can be found only in the last two paras of his order.,1
189,"Thus, no inquiry as such was made by the Tahsildar and the reasons which can be said of his own in the order are as under :""The provisions of Section 4(1) of the Bombay Paragana and Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act, 1950 are clear.",5

246,"In our view, it would be more appropriate and desirable to have such issues considered effectively, initially by the High Court and that the matter should be for that purpose relegated to the High Court by setting aside order of the learned Single Judge summarily dismissing the review petition by a non-speaking order.",4

254,"For rejecting the application, the learned Single Judge held that the point of limitation was not raised in the beginning and it was raised first time after order of remand was made by appellate revenue authority.",2
255,This observation was not factually correct as in the proceeding filed in the year 1976 itself this point was raised and that can be seen from the order of S.D.O.,4
256,which is already quoted.,0
257,"For rejecting the second point, the entitlement of purchaser to get regrant, the learned Single Judge held that the fact that Nazarana amount (purchase price) was not paid by holder within the period of five years was not raised initially and so, this ground cannot be considered.",6
258,The learned Single Judge referred the observations made by the authority under Maharashtra Land Revenue Code that probably the amount of Nazarana which was deposited by the purchaser was deposited on behalf of Watandar and these observations were not challenged by the purchasers.,2
259,The learned Single Judge considered one more point of 'commutation settlement'.,2
260,The point 'commutation settlement' was not at all involved as no such application was made under the Act or under the Act of 1874.,1
261,The learned Single Judge held that Government Resolution dated 2.2.1953 is not applicable.,4
262,The LPA No.,1
263,"10/2004 provision of section 4A of the Act is touched, but the point like whether the State Government has power to dispose of the property as it deems fit if the right of holder of Watan is extinguished, is not considered by the learned Single Judge.",8
264,It is observed that the order of regrant made in favour of purchaser was set aside by appellate revenue authority when there was no such specific order and the order was only of remand and inquiry.,3
265,"8) The learned Senior Counsel for present appellants submitted that learned Single Judge first time considered the point of limitation in review application and he also first time considered the provision of section 4A of the Act and circular of State Government of 1953 and as those points are decided first time, the L.P.A.",11

297,The Apex Court considered the bar created by provision of section 104 (2) of C.P.C.,4
298,and other provisions mentioned above and laid down that the bar would not operate and right of intra-court appeal provided by Letters Patent is saved from that bar.,3
299,The Apex Court observed that for deciding whether L.P.A.,1
300,"is maintainable, the provisions of Letters Patent and C.P.C.",1
301,need to be read harmoniously so as to save the appeal which is otherwise provided for.,1

308,"Similarly, the effect, if any, on the entitlement or claim of party like present appellants, purchasers to get occupancy right in view of the provisions of section 4, section 4A of the Act and circular of 1953 issued by the State Government is considered first time in the review proceeding by the learned Single Judge.",10
309,If object behind the L.P.A.,0
310,"is kept in mind, it needs to be held that Division Bench of this Court is expected to ascertain the correctness of the decision of the learned Single Judge on these points first in L.P.A.",5

347,was tenable as the order made under such provision amounts to judgment.,1
348,"Thus, the point is settled by the Apex Court and it is laid down that for ascertaining as to whether the decision is judgment or not, it needs to be considered as to whether the proceeding like review in which controversy was raised by the parties affect their valuable rights and the result of review deprive either party of the rights accrued.",2
349,That may happen after considering the provisions of law or the facts which were not considered and which could have changed the decision of review and that can happen when the rights are reconsidered in view of the provisions of law and facts which were not touched in the past by review Court.,4

438,23) The aforesaid provisions show that the period of five years was given by way of amendment of 1954 to the holder to pay the occupancy price and get the occupancy rights.,4
439,Prior to that from 1.5.1951 there was a period of three years given to the holder of Watan.,1

462,Government is pleaded to issue the following instructions for the information and guidance of the Collector in the matter.,1
463,I. Pargana watan lands can be classified into two categories:- (1) alienable and (2) inalieable.,0
464,Alienable watan lands are those which by the terms the commutation settlement itself are permitted to be alienated without any restriction.,0
465,"For instance, in the district of Surat, Desaigiri Hak is alienable by the terms of the settlement and in LPA No.",2

470,First para of the circular shows that the circular was issued for considering the rights of alienees of life interest also and to cover other situations.,1

477,"The alienations falling under (iii) are also saved by the proviso to sub section (3) of Section 3 and the alieness, being watandars of the same watan would be considered as holders of the watan would be considered as holders of the watan entitled to regrant under sub section (1) of Section 4 on payment of the occupancy price.",3
478,"These alienations would include the alienations made by the original watandar subsequent to the Watan Act as well as the alienations made by the jadid grantees, provided the alieness are watandars of the same watan.",1
479,"So far as the alienations falling under (ii) are concerned, that is to say, alienations of a life interest, the alieness would not be considered as holders of the watan and prima facie, the alienor watanda would be the holder of the watan entitled to the regrant of the land.",1
480,"If, however, the alieness pay the occupancy price to save their own rights, for fear that the alienor watandar might not pay, the occupancy price paid by these alienees should be accepted and the regrant made to the alienor watandar without prejudice to the rights of the LPA No.",1
481,"10/2004 alienees There may be certain alienations which are not permissible under Section 5 of the Watan Act, in the absence of fraud and collusion, adverse possession of watan lands for twelve years after the death of the alienor watandar bars succeeding holders.",4
482,This principle of adverse possession will apply even to alienations of life interest against the succeeding holders.,0
483,"Although the bar of limitation will not apply to Government, these alienated lands for lands for which the watandar's right is barred may be treated as having ceased to be watan lands provided Government has taken no action to resume, restore or levy rent and the persons in occupations as occupants.",2

487,V. In cases where the holder of the watan does not pay the occupancy price under sub section (1) of Section 4 of the Act within the stipulated time LPA No.,5
488,"10/2004 the lands would be resumed and regranted to the person who are in actual possession on payment of the occupancy price equal to twenty six or thirty two times the assessment according as the lands were un-assigned or assigned for remuneration of service and such regrant would be on old tenure.""",2
489,"29) It is already observed that there is no record to show that by using the provision of section 23 of the Act, there was assignment of the lands by Collector and there is no record to show that in the year 1944, the vendor was discharging some duties as officiator.",5
490,"Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141130310/ 22 Keshavrao Tulshiram Patil Since ... vs State Of Maha & Ors on 10 January, 2019 30) In view of the aforesaid portions of the circular dated 2.2.1953, there were two options available to the purchaser to protect his possession.",8
491,"As per first option, the purchaser could have deposited the occupancy price within five years for the holder and there could have been order of regrant in favour of holder of Watan.",0
492,The other option was there as provided in part V of the circular to get rights in his own favour.,1
493,"As the aforesaid provisions show that due to life interest purchased by the appellants, purchasers, there was no possibility of disturbing his possession, the purchaser could have exercised right given in V part of circular quoted above.",2
494,In that part of circular price mentioned is higher than six times the LPA No.,1
495,10/2004 assessment of lands and it is the contention of the appellant that occupancy price equal to six times of assessment was accepted from purchaser.,2
496,This circumstance cannot make difference and it cannot give anything to the holder or successors of holder of Watan as this matter is between the Government and the appellants.,1
497,It can be said that the inference is available that the land was given for discharging duties by the officiators as price equal to six times of the assessment is accepted and no more inference is possible from this circumstance.,0
498,The contentions and the record show that the order was made in favour of purchaser of the occupancy rights in the terms of new and impertible tenure.,1
499,"Thus rights were given to stranger to Watan, purchaser.",0
500,"In view of the aforesaid policy decision of the Government, it was possible for the State Government to give this right to person who was stranger to Watan.",2
501,This policy is not at all touched by the revenue appellate authority and even the learned Single Judge has not considered that policy of the Government even in review application.,3
502,"It is simply held that the purchaser cannot be treated as holder and so, he was not entitled to get regrant.",1
503,"As per the directions of the Apex Court, it was necessary for the learned Single Judge to consider the entitlement of the purchaser to get the occupancy rights not only in view of the provisions of the Act, but in view of the circulars and G.Rs.",2
504,of the State Government.,2
505,This was not done by the learned Single Judge and on that error is committed LPA No.,2
506,10/2004 by the learned Single Judge.,1
507,31) It is already observed that it was not possible for holder to get order of regrant in view of the period prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Act and the policy decision of the Government expressed in the Circular.,5
508,"In the policy decision, it is also mentioned as to how the possession of the purchaser of life interest becomes adverse to the successors of the holder.",0
509,"Due to this circumstance, the provision of section 27 of the Limitation Act needs to be considered against the successors of holder.",5
510,"The provision is as under :""27.",1
511,Extinguishment of right to property.,0
512,"- At the determination of the period hereby limited to any person for instituting a suit for possession of any property, his right to such property shall be extinguished.""",1
513,"32) Thus, when there was the sale deed executed on behalf of the persons who were probably entitled for holding the property of Watan, respondent Nos.",0
514,8 to 10 ought to have challenged the sale deed within 12 years atleast from the year of giving of occupancy rights to the purchaser.,0
515,"The rights were given in the year 1956 and so, the proceeding filed as appeal before revenue authority by respondent No.",7
516,8 was not at all tenable.,0
517,"From this angle, revenue LPA No.",1
518,10/2004 authority had not considered the proceeding filed by respondent No.,3
519,8 Dinanath and learned Single Judge has also not touched the point of limitation from this angle.,1
520,"In the result, even when no interest was left with Dinanath in the disputed property, the so called claim was considered and when it was not possible Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141130310/ 23 Keshavrao Tulshiram Patil Since ... vs State Of Maha & Ors on 10 January, 2019 to set aside the order made in favour of purchaser in the year 1956 the matter was remanded back for fresh inquiry by the appellate revenue authority.",13
521,"So, this Court holds that all the proceedings which were started in the year 1976 have not disturbed the position which was created in the year 1956 in favour of purchaser.",6
522,33) The proceeding which was filed before S.D.O.,1
523,by respondent No.,1
524,"8 Dinanath was under the provisions of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966.",3
525,"Even if the provisions of Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879 are considered, the period available to file appeal was only 60 days from the date of order made in the year 1956.",6
526,The vendor Ramchandra and respondent No.,1
527,8 Dinanath could have challenged the order of 1956 immediately in the year 1956 as it needs to be presumed in view of section 114 of the Evidence Act that proper procedure was followed by revenue authority before making the order in favour of purchaser.,6
528,"Further, section 7 of the Limitation Act needs to be used against respondent No.",4
529,8 Dinanath and others as Ramchandra was alive in the year 1956 and probably LPA No.,4
530,10/2004 all the successors of Ramchandra were major and Ramchandra could have represented even minor in the year 1956 in view of the provision of section 7 of the Limitation Act.,7
531,"Further, as already observed when the purchase price was not deposited within five years from the appointed day by the holder, their rights became extinguished and so, there was no necessity for issuing notices to them in a proceeding which was started by the purchaser in the year 1956.",4
532,In the year 1976 the point of limitation atleast in respect of appeal was specifically raised by the purchaser and that can be seen in the first order made by S.D.O.,4
533,by which the proceeding filed by successors of holder was dismissed by S.D.O.,2
534,The learned Single Judge has committed error in observing that the point of limitation was not raised at initial stage.,1
535,"Further, no separate application for condonation of delay caused in filing appeal in the year 1976 was filed by successor of holder and on this point also, the learned Single Judge has committed error.",6
536,The relevant case law was cited for the purchaser and that is being discussed hereinafter.,1
537,34) In the case reported as (2001) 9 SCC 717 [Ragho Singh Vs. Mohan Singh and Ors.,3
538,"], the Apex Court has laid down that if application for condonation of delay caused in filing appeal even before Collector is not accompanied with appeal, the appeal needs to be dismissed.",3
539,When there are circumstances like present LPA No.,1
540,"10/2004 one, the delay point needs to be addressed more seriously even by revenue authority and it was a proceeding of appeal.",1
541,This was not done and the learned Single Judge has also committed error on this point.,1
542,The learned counsel for respondent No.,2
543,8 placed reliance on some observations made in the case reported as (2007) 4 SCC 221 [A.V.,1
544,Papayya Sastry and Ors.,0
545,Vs. Govt.,2
546,of A.P.,0
547,and Ors.],0
548,.,0
549,"In this case, the Apex Court has discussed the power of the State Government to exercise revisional jurisdiction (not appellate jurisdiction).",2
550,"It is observed by the Apex Court that if the decree or order is obtained by fraud, it can be treated as non est and nullity.",2
551,It is observed that if fraud is played the revisional jurisdiction can be exercised even after 10 years from the date of decision.,1
552,"Thus, the Apex Court held that the revisional jurisdiction could have been exercised even after 10 years and that period of 10 years was held to be reasonable period.",3
553,Facts were totally different.,0
554,"In the present case, there was no question of fraud and in view of the discussion made above, the revenue appellate authority ought to have dismissd the appeal.",2
555,"On this point, the learned Senior Counsel for appellant placed reliance on the case reported as (2009) 9 SCC 352 [Santoshkumar Shivgonda Patil and Ors.",3
556,Vs. Balasaheb Tukaram Shevale and Ors.].,2
557,"In this case, the Apex Court held that if no period of limitation is fixed by the statute for suo motu revision, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141130310/ 24 Keshavrao Tulshiram Patil Since ... vs State Of Maha & Ors on 10 January, 2019 the power should be exercised within reasonable time.",9
558,Specifically LPA No.,1
559,"10/2004 by referring the provision of section 257 of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, the Apex Court held that such power could have been exercised within three years from the date of the decision.",4
560,One more case was cited on this point reported as 2005(4) ALL MR 975 [Annappa Satu Mane Vs. Tanaji Balu Shinde & Ors.],5
561,.,0
562,"Thus, it is settled law that the point of delay caused in filing proceeding like appeal needs to be considered first as for getting condonation of delay, sufficient cause is required to be shown and the circumstance that the vested rights cannot be disturbed after prescribed period of limitation needs to be kept in mind by the Court or the authority while considering the delay condonation application.",3
563,35) The learned counsel for respondent Nos.,1
564,8 to 10 placed reliance on the observations made by the Karnataka High Court in the case reported as AIR 1994 KARNATAKA 227 [Syed Bhasheer Ahamed and Ors.,3
565,Vs. State of Karnataka and Ors.],3
566,and submitted that any transaction made prior to coming into force of Watan Abolition Act need to be treated as void.,1
567,In that case Karnataka Act was considered and the subsequent policy of Karnataka State treating the procedure for getting permission to alienate occupancy rights as formality was also considered.,5
568,"In view of that policy, some observations are made by the Karnataka High Court.",0
569,The relevant facts and provisions of present case are already LPA No.,3
570,10/2004 quoted and specific policy of Maharashtra State is also quoted.,1
571,"Further, the learned Senior Counsel for appellants placed reliance on the ratio of Apex Court reported as (2016) 4 SCC 147 [V. Venkateshappa Vs. Munemma and Ors.].",3
572,In this case the Apex Court held in favour of purchaser by laying down the law on doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel to alienee and held that the principle needs to be used if transfer was made before regrant and subsequently holder got the right to get regrant.,2
573,The Apex Court held that if there alienee already in possession of the property then he cannot be ejected if the provisions of Watan Abolition Act or Inam Abolition Act are considered.,4
574,It can be said that the policy of the Government changed to remove the difficulties which were faced due to alienation made by occupants against whom there were conditions imposed at the time of regrant of the land.,1
575,"Such provisions can be found in Maharashtra Inferior Village Watan Abolition Act, 1959, in section 3 of the Act.",4
576,"Thus, now regularization of such transfers is possible and this policy of the Government cannot be ignored.",1
577,"On the point of entitlement of person in possession of Watan property, there is one more case of this Court reported as 1995 (1) Mh.L.J.",4
578,732 [Shankar Ragnath Kulkarni Vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors.].,3
579,This case is on the provisions of the Act and also on Act of 1874.,3
580,"In that case also when the holder of Watan failed held to pay occupancy price within the prescribed time, LPA No.",2
581,10/2004 the Collector granted the lands to the persons in occupation of land as tenant for several years and this order of the Collector was held to be justified.,0
582,36) This Court holds that such matters are matters between the State on one hand and holder and transferee on the other.,2
583,It is open to the State to take policy decision as mentioned above.,1
584,"In view of the power which is available with the State, it can be said that the transfer made prior to coming into force of the Act like in the present matter and transfers made after coming into force of the Act cannot be distinguished as that will amount to discrimination.",2
585,"In the past also, subject to sanction, permission of the State Government, the transfer was possible as already mentioned.",2
586,"After coming into force of the Act, similar procedure was there for getting the permission of the authority of the State Government for alienating occupancy rights which were subject to some conditions.",3

588,This Court holds that it was not possible to interfere in the order made by revenue authority in the year 1956 in favour of appellants by which the occupancy rights LPA No.,5
