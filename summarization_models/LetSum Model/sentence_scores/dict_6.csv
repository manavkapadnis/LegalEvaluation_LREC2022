120,He submitted as follows.,0
121,"Although PWs 4 and 6 were not believed by the Learned Trial Court to be eye-witnesses, strangely PWs 7, 10 and 11 were regarded by the Learned Trial Court eye-witnesses.",1
122,There were serious contradictions between the depositions of PW 7 on one hand and PWs 10 and 11 on the other.,0
123,PW 7 did not give any account of initial conversation between the victim and the accused.,0
124,This makes the very presence of PW 7 at the place of occurrence during the relevant time doubtful.,0
125,Neither the offending weapon nor Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160425708/ 3 Gabbar Sk.,0
126,"@ Gabba Sk vs The State Of West Bengal on 10 June, 2019 the bicycle used were seized in this case.",6
127,There was no premeditation in the alleged commission of crime.,1
128,The PW 4's allusion to an enmity between the victims and the appellants was made for the first time in Court.,0
129,"If at all, at best Section 304 of the Penal Code could be attracted in this case.",3
130,7\.,0
131,Mr. N.P.,0
132,"Agarwala, the Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the State strongly supported the conviction and sentence.",1
133,He submitted as follows.,0
134,There were five witnesses in this case who claimed to be eye-witnesses.,1
135,"That apart, three post-occurrence witnesses, the post-mortem doctor and other police personnel supported the prosecution case.",1
136,"PW 4, the wife of the victim was a chance eye-witness.",0
137,"But, the Learned Trial Judge did not believe her version due to the inconsistency with the Investigating Officer.",2
138,So was the case of PW 6.,1
139,"But, PW 7 was the star eye-witness in this case.",1
140,He initiated the complaint.,0
141,He had accompanied the victim.,0
142,His statement was consistent.,0
143,The evidence adduced by PW 7 was substantially corroborated by PWs 10 and 11.,0
144,"Here what was of utmost significance was that PWs 7, 10 and 11 were only neighbours and not relations of the victim.",0
145,"The evidence of the eye- witnesses was fully corroborated by PW 8, the post-mortem doctor.",0
146,He found as many as twenty eight injuries on the deadbody.,0
147,Motive behind the murder came out from the evidence of PW 4 who deposed that there was an enmity between the accused and the victim over business matters.,0
148,"In his examination under Section 313 of the Code, the appellant gave no explanation about the circumstances appearing against him.",5
149,8\.,0
150,We heard the submissions of the Learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the appellant and the State and carefully went through the evidence and other materials on record to assess the correctness and legality of the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence.,2
151,Motive: 9\.,0
152,"PW 4, the wife of the victim, stated in her examination in chief that there was a dispute between the victim and the accused over business.",1
153,This gave out the motive behind the murder.,0
154,This testimony was not challenged in clear terms by the defence by way of cross-examination.,0
155,What was asked was whether this was stated to the Investigating Officer or not.,2
156,It is not sufficient to cross the Investigating Officer thereafter and try to fish out any inconsistency.,0
157,"Moreover, at the very inception PW 9, the de facto complainant and brother of the victim stated in the First Information Report that the accused assaulted the victim due to previous grudge.",1
158,Eye-witnesses: 10\.,0
159,We fully agree with the conclusion arrived at by the Learned Trial Judge that PWs 4 and 6 could not be regarded as eye-witnesses because of the inconsistencies their testimonies had with the evidence adduced by the Investigating Officer.,3
160,"PW 7, was a witness, in part, to the murderous assault by the accused.",0
161,"He did say that while returning from work from their own mango orchard, they were sitting in a 'mancha' and taking rest in the mango orchard of Ashu Khan, after which the accused came and assaulted the victim.",0
162,The only ostensible difference between PW 7's deposition and the depositions of the other two eye-witnesses PWs 10 and 11 is that PW 7 did not say anything about the brief initial interaction the victim had with accused.,0
163,We do not consider this to be a material contradiction.,0
164,PW 7 fled away from the place and intimated others.,0
165,"On the other hand, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160425708/ 4 Gabbar Sk.",0
166,"@ Gabba Sk vs The State Of West Bengal on 10 June, 2019 PWs stayed there and thus gave more complete details about the incident.",5
167,"In fact, PW 10 tried to prevent the accused from assaulting the victim, but failed.",0
168,PWs 10 and 11 gave vivid details of the assault.,0
169,The two accused chased the victim and hacked him with 'hensua'.,0
170,"The eye-witnesses PWs 7, 10 and 11 were not related to the victim and their evidence could not be shaken in the cross-examination.",0
171,Post-occurrence accounts: 11\.,0
172,"PWs 1, 2 and 9 were the post-occurrence witness to the incident.",0
173,Their depositions lend support to the prosecution case in good measure.,1
174,The deadbody was indeed found at the place of occurrence with multiple injuries.,0
175,Medical evidence: 12\.,0
176,There were as many as 28 sharp cutting injuries found on the victim's body.,0
177,This clearly supports the ocular evidence that accused chased the victim and hacked him mercilessly.,0
178,"PW 8, the post-mortem doctor, deposed that the death was due to ante-mortem injuries that were homicidal in nature.",0
179,The nature of injuries matched with use of a 'hensua'.,0
180,"Therefore, the medical evidence fully corroborated the ocular version.",0
181,A murder or a mere culpable homicide: 13\.,0
182,It is true that the number of injuries may not always be the guiding factor in determining whether it is a case of murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder.,2
183,"Nevertheless, here there were as many as 28 injuries inflicted by the accused with a sharp cutting weapon.",0
184,"Whether it was a pre- meditated murder or not, there was a previous dispute and grudge for providing a motive.",0
185,"Intention, as is well known, can be developed even immediately before the commission of a crime.",1
186,"What is of utmost importance here is that although PW 10 and another tried to prevent the accused from committing the crime, they thwarted such attempts and went on with their incessant assaults on the victim with an inexorable conviction.",0
187,"In view of these circumstances, we cannot treat this only as a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",1
188,14\.,0
189,"The convincing evidence adduced by the independent eye-witnesses, the corroborative medical evidence and the other evidence and materials on record unerringly point to the guilt of the appellant.",1
190,15\.,0
191,"In view of the above discussions, we hold that the prosecution case has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt as against the appellant and hence, the appeal is dismissed and the conviction and sentence are affirmed.",6
192,16\.,0
193,"The judgment was made ready only on 24.05.2019, the last day before the intervening summer vacation.",0
194,"As such, the same is being delivered today on the first day after the reopening of the Court.",2
