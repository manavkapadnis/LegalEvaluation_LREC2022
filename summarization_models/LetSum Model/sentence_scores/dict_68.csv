153,"This argument, in light of the above discussion, does not appeal to usâ€¦â€ (emphasis supplied) It is for the same reasoning that we are of the opinion that the High Courtâ€™s reliance on the judgment of this Court in Orissa 16 17 Lift Irrigation Corporation Ltd. v.

220,"While dealing with the aforesaid proposition of law, the Court analysed the purpose and scope of the PC Act and made the following observations: â€œ15.",2
221,From the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the PC Bill it is clear that the Act was intended to make the antiÂ­corruption law more effective by widening its coverage.,1
222,It is also clear that the Bill was introduced to widen the scope of the definition of â€œpublic servantâ€.,0

227,"The above definition shows that under subÂ­ clause (viii) contained in Section 2(c) of the PC Act, 1988, a person who holds an office by virtue of which he is authorised or required to perform any public duty, is a public servant.",2
228,"Now, for the purposes of the present case this Court is required to examine as to whether the Chairman/Managing Director or Executive Director of a private bank operating under licence issued by RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, held/holds an office and performed/performs public duty so as to attract the definition of â€œpublic servantâ€ quoted above.â€ (emphasis supplied) 47\.",2
229,This Court in the case of P.V.,2
230,"Narasimha Rao v. State (CBI/SPE), (1998) 4 SCC 626, has clarified the word â€œofficeâ€ in the following manner: â€œ61.",2

232,"(See Oxford Shorter English Dictionary, 3rd Edn., p.",0
233,1362.),0
234,"In McMillan v. Guest, (1942) 1 All ER 606 (HL), Lord Wright has said: â€˜â€¦The word â€œofficeâ€ is of indefinite content.",1
235,"Its various meanings cover four 24 25 columns of the New English Dictionary, but I take as the most relevant for purposes of this case the following: â€œA position or place to which certain duties are attached, especially one of a more or less public character.â€â€™ In the same case Lord Atkin gave the following meaning: â€˜â€¦â€œan office or employment which was subsisting, permanent, substantive position, which had an existence independent of the person who filled it, which went on and was filled in succession by successive holders.â€â€™ In Statesman (P) Ltd. v. H.R.",2
236,"Deb, AIR 1968 SC 1495 and Mahadeo v. Shantibhai, (1969) 2 SCR 422 this Court has adopted the meaning given by Lord Wright when it said: â€˜An office means no more than a position to which certain duties are attached.â€™â€ 48\.",4
237,"This Court in the case of Manish Trivedi v. State of Rajasthan, (2014) 14 SCC 420 further elucidated upon the ambit of the phrase â€œpublic servantâ€ by stressing upon the relevance of â€œofficeâ€, wherein the emphasis was upon the duties performed.",4

239,The present Act (the 1988 Act) envisages widening of the scope of the definition of the expression â€œpublic servantâ€.,3
240,It was brought in force to purify public administration.,0
241,The legislature has used 25 26 a comprehensive definition of â€œpublic servantâ€ to achieve the purpose of punishing and curbing corruption among public servants.,0
242,"Hence, it would be inappropriate to limit the contents of the definition clause by a construction which would be against the spirit of the statute.",0
243,"Bearing in mind this principle, when we consider the case of the appellant, we have no doubt that he is a public servant within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act.",4
244,"Clause (viii) of Section 2(c) of the present Act makes any person, who holds an office by virtue of which he is authorised or required to perform any public duty, to be a public servant.",3

246,"In order to appreciate the amplitude of the word â€œpublic servantâ€, the relevance of the term â€œpublic dutyâ€ cannot be disregarded.",1
247,"â€œPublic dutyâ€ is defined under Section 2(b) of the PC Act, which is reproduced below: 2(b) â€˜public dutyâ€™ means a duty in the discharge of which the State, the public or the community at large has an interest.",3
248,50\.,0
249,"Evidently, the language of Section 2(b) of the PC Act indicates that any duty discharged wherein State, the public or community at large has any interest is called a public duty.",3
250,The first explanation to Section 2 further clarifies that any person who falls in any of the categories stated under Section 2 is a public 26 27 servant whether or not appointed by the government.,6
251,"The second explanation further expands the ambit to include every person who de facto discharges the functions of a public servant, and that he should not be prevented from being brought under the ambit of public servant due to any legal infirmities or technicalities.",1

254,52\.,0
255,The charge sheet specifically discloses that the respondent allegedly was collecting certain extra amount over the prescribed fees on the pretext of allowing the students to fill up their examination forms.,1
256,"Therefore, paying the respondent the alleged amount was a condition precedent before filling up the forms, to appear for the examinations.",1
257,"Specifically, in the complaint, it was alleged that the respondent had demanded an amount of Rupees Twenty Lakhs to be paid to the coÂ­accused Bharat Savant, failing 27 28 which the daughter of the complainant would not have been permitted to appear in the examination.",1
258,"In our opinion, the fact that there were a large number of cheques which were found during the raid is more than sufficient to establish a grave suspicion as to the commission of the alleged offence.",2
259,53\.,0
260,The respondent has vehemently stressed upon the fact that he is admittedly a trustee of the â€œSumandeep Charitable Trustâ€ and has no connection with the â€œSumandeep Universityâ€.,1
261,"But, it ought to be noted that the courts below have failed to analyze the connection between the trust and the University, as well as the relationship of the respondent with the university.",0
262,"Prima facie, a grave suspicion is made out that the respondent was rendering his service by dealing with the students and the examination aspect of the University.",1

265,"At this stage, we may note that the jurisdiction of this Court, with regards to Section 227 of CrPC, is limited and should not be excercised by conducting roving enquiries on the aspect of factual inferences.",4
266,"This Court, in Union of India Vs. Prafulla Kumar 28 29 Samal, 1979 (3) SCC 4, had an occasion to consider the scope of Section 227 CrPC and it held as under: â€œ7.",7
267,"Section 227 of the Code runs thus: â€œIf, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing.â€ The words â€œnot sufficient ground for proceeding against the accusedâ€ clearly show that the Judge is not a mere post office to frame the charge at the behest of the prosecution, but has to exercise his judicial mind to the facts of the case in order to determine whether a case for trial has been made out by the prosecution.",6
268,"In assessing this fact, it is not necessary for the court to enter into the pros and cons of the matter or into a weighing and balancing of evidence and probabilities which is really his function after the trial starts.",1
269,"At the stage of Section 227, the Judge has merely to sift the evidence in order to find out whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.",4
270,The sufficiency of ground would take within its fold the nature of the evidence recorded by the police or the documents produced before the court which ex facie disclose that there are suspicious circumstances against the accused so as to frame a charge against him.â€ 55\.,0
271,"Further, in Sajjan Kumar v. Central Bureau of Investigation, 2010 (9) SCC 368, this Court, inter alia, observed : 29 30 â€œ21.",5
