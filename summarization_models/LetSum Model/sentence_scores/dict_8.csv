42,7\.,0
43,"Learned counsel for the appellant in support of the appeal submits that PW11 informant being brother of the appellant and PW13 being husband of the niece of the deceased were all close relatives and interested witnesses, the Courts below committed an error in relying on the testimony of interested witnesses.",3
44,There being no independent witnesses corroborating the charge against the appellants the appellants ought not to have been convicted and sentenced.,0
45,"It is further submitted that PW5, who claimed to be an eyewitness and deposed before the courts below that he saw four accused running away from the spot, he has not taken the name of Ram Pravesh Dubey, the appellant No.2.",1

52,Learned counsel appearing for the State refuting the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant submits that informant PW11 was accompanying the deceased and his evidence was found trustworthy.,3
53,The Courts below did not commit an error in relying on his evidence.,0
54,It is submitted that the mere fact that PW11 and PW13 are related to the deceased does not in any manner impeach their truthfulness.,1
55,It is submitted that the mention of the bullet injury in the inquest report was due to error of judgment by the person writing inquest report.,0
56,"The skull being crushed in a manner and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 2 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 bones being fractured, impression was drawn that bullet entered from behind the skull and came out of the mouth, which in no manner can be said to be fatal to the prosecution case.",6
57,"It is submitted that PW5 is a trustworthy witness, who is not related to the deceased and saw the accused running away from the spot.",0
58,9\.,0
59,We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.,2
60,10\.,0
61,"PW11, who is a brother of the deceased, has fully corroborated the prosecution case in his evidence.",1
62,"In spite of thorough cross- examination, the witnesses could not be shaken.",0
63,The submission of the appellant that witnesses PW11 and PW13 being related to the deceased are interested witnesses and should not be relied does not commend us.,1
64,The mere fact that deceased was brother of the informant and PW13 is the husband of the niece of the deceased and does not impeach their evidence in any manner.,1
65,The mere fact that witness is related does not lead to inference that such witness is an interested witness.,1
66,This Court has occasion to consider such submission in number of cases.,1
67,"In Kartik Malhar Vs. State of Bihar, (1996) 1 SCC 614, this Court held that a close relative who is a very natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness.",5
68,In paragraph Nos.,0
69,"15 and 16, following was laid down:15.",1
70,"As to the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the witness was the widow of the deceased and was, therefore, highly interested and her statement be discarded, we may observe that a close relative who is a natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness.",3
71,The term interested postulates that the witness must have some direct interest in having the accused somehow or the other convicted for some animus or for some other reason.,0
72,"In Dalbir Kaur (Mst) v. State of Punjab, (1976) 4 SCC 158, it has been observed as under: (SCC pp.",3
73,"167-68, para 11) Moreover, a close relative who is a very natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness.",0
74,The term interested postulates that the person concerned must have some direct interest in seeing that the accused person is somehow or the other convicted either because he had some animus with the accused or for some other reason.,0
75,Such is not the case here.,1
76,16\.,0
77,"In Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 364 it has laid down as under: A witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely.",6
78,"Ordinarily, a close relative would be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person.",0
79,"It is true, when feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there is tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth.",1
80,"However, we are not attempting any sweeping generalisation.",0
81,Each case must be judged on its own facts.,1
82,"Our observations are only made to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 3 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 combat what is so often put forward in cases before us as a general rule of prudence.",6
83,There is no such general rule.,0
84,Each case must be limited to and be governed by its own facts.,1
85,11\.,0
86,"Further in Namdeo Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2007) 14 SCC 150, same propositions were reiterated by this court elaborately referring to the earlier judgments, this Court rejected the same submission in paragraph Nos.",6
87,"29, 30 and 38, which are to the following effect:29.",0
88,"It was then contended that the only eyewitness, PW 6 Sopan was none other than the son of the deceased.",1
89,"He was, therefore, highly interested witness and his deposition should, therefore, be discarded as it has not been corroborated in material particulars by other witnesses.",0
90,We are unable to uphold the contention.,1
91,"In our judgment, a witness who is a relative of the deceased or victim of a crime cannot be characterised as interested.",0
92,The term interested postulates that the witness has some direct or indirect interest in having the accused somehow or the other convicted due to animus or for some other oblique motive.,0
93,30\.,0
94,"Before more than half a century, in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 364, a similar question came up for consideration before this Court.",6
95,"In that case, the High Court observed that testimony of two eyewitnesses required corroboration since they were closely related to the deceased.",1
96,"Commenting on the approach of the High Court, this Court held that it was unable to concur with the said view.",2
97,"Referring to an earlier decision in Rameshwar Kalyan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1952 SC 54, Their Lordships observed that it was a fallacy common to many criminal cases and in spite of endeavours to dispel, it unfortunately still persists, if not in the judgments of the courts, at any rate in the arguments of counsel (Dalip Singh case, AIR p. 366, para 25).",5
98,38\.,0
99,"From the above case law, it is clear that a close relative cannot be characterised as an interested witness.",1
100,He is a natural witness.,0
101,"His evidence, however, must be scrutinised carefully.",0
102,"If on such scrutiny, his evidence is found to be intrinsically reliable, inherently probable and wholly trustworthy, conviction can be based on the sole testimony of such witness.",0
103,Close relationship of witness with the deceased or victim is no ground to reject his evidence.,0
104,"On the contrary, close relative of the deceased would normally be most reluctant to spare the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent one.",0
105,12\.,0
106,"We, thus, reject the submission of the appellant that PW11 and PW13 being related to deceased, their evidence cannot be relied.",1
107,13\.,0
108,"Now, the next submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that PW5, who is held to be an eyewitness has in his statement only taken names of the four accused, who, according to him, were seen running away from the spot.",2
109,"It is submitted that PW5 did not take the name of Ram Pravesh Dubey, the appellant No.2.",1
110,The statement of PW5 has been brought on the record.,0
111,"PW5 in his statement stated that at 9 Oclock in the morning, he had gone to Sasaram and when he went about fifty steps south to Rouza Road from G.T.",2
112,"Road, he saw the accused persons namely Ram Nandan Dusadh, Dudnath Dusadh, Jamadar Dusadh and Shankar Dubey fleeing on Rouza Road going from the west to the east.",0
113,"It is true that in his statement, he mentioned names of only four persons, who Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 4 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 were seen fleeing on Rouza Road.",5
114,The mere fact that he did not mention name of Ram Pravesh Dubey cannot lead to the inference that Ram Pravesh Dubey was not involved in the incident.,1
115,"There may be several reasons due to which, he could not see Ram Pravesh Dubey.",1
116,"When PW11 and PW13, whose evidence has been relied by the trial court as well as High Court, have categorically proved the presence of Ram Pravesh Dubey and his participation in the occurrence.",2
117,"The mere fact that PW5 did not see Ram Pravesh Dubey fleeing is not conclusive nor on that basis, we can come to any inference that Ram Pravesh Dubey was not involved in the occurrence.",1
118,14\.,0
119,"Now, we come to the another submission of the appellants that in the inquest report, it was mentioned that pellet from back in the head has come out of the mouth, but there was no bullet injury found in the post mortem report.",0
120,"In column No.5 of the inquest report brought as Annexure-P42, following was stated:It appears that the pellet from back in the head has come out of the mouth.",0
121,(illegible) part has been cut.,0

152,"A perusal of the injuries, which have been noticed in the post mortem report indicates that there was fracture of occipital bone in two multiple pieces at back of the head.",0
153,Some fragments of bone had pierced into brain covering.,0
154,"Multiple fracture of right mallar bone, nosal bone and right maxilla has also been noticed.",0
155,"The nature of the injuries, which were found in the post mortem report indicates that on seeing the injuries, the officers recording the inquest report thought that since occipital bone in two multiple pieces at back of head have been fractured and some fragments of bone had pierced into brain covering, the bullet entered from the back side of the head and came out of the mouth, which is noticed in the inquest report and the officer writing the inquest report made his opinion by seeing the injury by bare eyes.",0
156,The nature of injuries especially injury in the back of head led him to believe that bullet entered from back of the head and came out of the mouth.,0
157,"The above impression recorded in the inquest report was only opinion of person preparing inquest report and due to the above impression recorded in the inquest report and no bullet having been found in the post mortem report, it cannot be concluded that incident did not happen in a manner as claimed by the prosecution.",0
158,The mention of bullet injury was only an opinion of the officer writing the inquest report and in no manner belies the prosecution case as proved by eyewitnesses PW11 and PW13.,1
159,18\.,0
160,Learned counsel for the appellant has further contended that there was no motive proved.,3
161,"PW11 in his statement clearly mentioned that as his nephew had contested election against the accused Shio Shankar Dubey for the post of Mukhiya, due to which Shio Shankar Dubey was angry with his deceased brother.",0

163,Accused Shiv Shankar Dubey was the Mukhiya of my Gram Panchayat Gotpar Khatadihri at the time of occurrence.,0
164,My nephew Ram Bachan Singh had contested election against the accused Shio Shankar Dubey for the post of Mukhiya.,0
165,This is why Shio Shankar Dubey was angry with my deceased brother and all the accused jointly murdered him.,0
166,Bikram Dusadh had been jailed three to four days earlier to this occurrence.,0
167,He was full brother of the accused namely Dudnath Dusadh and Jamadaar Dusadh and son of the accused Ram Nandan Dusadh.,0

175,"At 9.30 AM, the fardbeyan has been proved.",0
176,The inquest report and the seizure report were provided at 10.00 AM and 10.15 AM respectively on the spot.,0
177,FIR was sent to the court on 17.05.1980.,0
178,Trial court has noticed the entire sequence of the events and has rightly come to the conclusion that there was no opportunity for the informant to implicate other leaving the real culprits.,3
179,In paragraph Nos.,0
180,"72, 73 and 74, the trial court records following:72.",2
181,The salient feature of the present case is that the occurrence took place at 9 a.m. on 16-5-80.,1
182,The Fardbeyan was recorded at 9-30 a.m. at the place of occurrence.,0
183,The inquest report and the seizure list was prepared at 10 a.m. and 10.15 a.m. respectively at the spot.,0

196,74\.,0
197,From the facts mentioned in the above para there was no opportunity for the informant to implicate other leaving the real culprit.,0
