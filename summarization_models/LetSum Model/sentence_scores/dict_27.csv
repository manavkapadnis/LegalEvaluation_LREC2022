15,The other two cheques were lying unencashed with the department.,0
16,"Thereafter, the appellants have invested substantial sum of money for executing the ground work before setting up of an educational institution with ancillary facilities.",0
17,"3) According to the appellants, the Fisheries Department by a letter dated 11th July, 2013 communicated the following:""in inviting you kind attention to the above mentioned reference and subject, the undersigned is directed to inform you that as per decision taken by other related Departments, this department has been advised to take immediate action for cancellation of the Lease Deed already executed to this effect and request you to report to this deptt.",3

27,The appellants continued to be in possession of the said plot of land and to protect their rights filed a suit before the learned District Court.,2
28,"The said suit, however, has not been proceeded with by the appellants after finding the Fisheries Department has not taken any step upon issuing the notices in 2013.",3
29,"5) The appellants, subsequently, by a letter dated 7th February, 2018 requested the Fisheries Department to reconsider and revalidate the lease.",3
30,"In the said letter, the appellants has set out the entire facts relevant to the case.",1

72,"9) These letters were brought on record by the appellants by way of a supplementary affidavit affirmed on 9th October, 2018.",2
73,"10) After going through the letters referred to hereinabove, it appears that the Fisheries Department was in possession of the said plot of land along with surrounding lands for several years and, as such, it leased out the said plot of land by a registered deed upon receiving three years lease rent in advance from the appellants.",0
74,"Subsequently, the Fisheries Department was advised by other departments that the lease was illegal and, as such, the same should be cancelled.",0
75,The alleged ground of termination is that the Fisheries Department are not the owners of the said land.,0
76,"The land, however, belongs to the Government which is not in dispute.",1
77,"It is also the contention of the respondents that of the Land Reforms Department, Government of West Bengal owns the said plot of land.",2
78,"11) Be that as it may, the appellants' entry to the said land and to the possession thereof was by dint of a registered deed of lease dated 26th May, 2010 for 99 years executed by the Fisheries Department, Government of West Bengal.",4
79,"The appellants believed in the representations made by the Fisheries Department and altered its position by relying upon such representations and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67991442/ 4 Anil Gupta & Ors vs The State Of West Bengal & Ors on 28 February, 2019 believing them to be true and correct.",7
80,"Assuming without admitting that the Fisheries Department was not the actual owner of the said land but, it belongs to another government department then also the appellants did not enter into possession of the land of its own so as to be termed as a rank trespasser.",1
81,"In such a situation, we find that the appellants cannot be hauled up for any fault of themselves.",0
82,It is the Fisheries Department who has created the mess.,0
83,"The appellants' possession, therefore, cannot said to be unlawful without the allegations made by the Fisheries Department and the Land Reforms Department are proved.",0
84,The writ court cannot go into the validity or invalidity of the title or of the lease deed.,0
85,"Therefore, it cannot be said that the appellants has entered into possession of the said plot of land without any authority.",0
86,"Its possession may be at best be irregular on the land being found not to be that of the Fisheries Department but belonging to the Land Reforms Department, since the character of the land remains to be a government land whether it belongs to any other government department.",2
87,"In such a situation, neither the Fisheries Department nor the Special Officer, Shankarpur Fishing Harbour could have dispossessed the appellants without due process of law.",2
88,"The writ petition was moved on 12th October, 2018 when the learned Single Judge held that ""The issue raised in the writ petition are such that an opportunity should be awarded to the respondents to file affidavit"".",4
89,Affidavit- in-opposition was to be filed within two weeks from the dated of the said order.,2

96,"12) On 22nd November, 2018 the appellants filed a supplementary affidavit in the application for restoration of possession stating specifically that they were dispossessed on 18th November, 2018 which date was missing in the said restoration of possession application.",4
97,"13) The application for restoration of possession was heard on 26th November, 2018 when the learned Single Judge passed the following order:""Supplementary affidavit filed in Court today be taken on record.",5
98,None appears for the respondents.,0
99,"In the present application, the applicants claim that, they were dispossessed subsequent to the filing of the writ petition.",0

107,"Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be made available to the parties upon compliance of the requisite formalities.""",0
108,"14) We find that the appellants have specifically urged that they were dispossessed during the pendency of the writ petition as there was no interim order directing its possession, though it had approached the Court prior to being actually dispossessed.",0
109,"Prior to moving the application for restoration of possession the appellants had stated by way of a supplementary affidavit that they were dispossessed on 19th November, 2018.",3
110,There is no denial of that fact that either orally or by way of an affidavit even when the appeal is heard.,4
111,"On the contrary, the respondent nos.",0
112,1 to 6 has tried to justify the taking over of possession.,0
113,15) It is well settled principle of law that even a trespasser cannot be evicted without due process of law.,2
114,It is also well settled that doctrine of frustration does not apply to leases.,0
115,"Noticing the above factual matrix, we invited the parties for a practical amicable solution to the issue of dispossession.",0
116,"The appellants expressed their intention to abide by any reasonable offer or solution in line with the lease deed dated 26th May, 2010.",3
117,The respondent nos.,0
118,"1 to 6, however, came up with an instruction from the Department of Land and Land Reforms and Refugee Reliefs and Rehabilitation Department, Government of West Bengal dated 22nd January, 2019.",4
119,"The instruction so handed over to the Court reads as follows:""With reference to above, the undersigned is directed to offer the views of this Department as under""In so far as allotment of Govt.",0
120,Land on LTS to the private Companies/Trusts etc.,0
121,"is guided by the Land Allotment Policy, 2012, if applied for.",0
122,The petitioners may apply before this Deptt.,1
123,accordingly.,1
124,"While considering the said LTS on merit the requisite payment of Salami and annual rent will have to be paid by the would be lessee.""",0
125,"On perusal of such instruction, it appears that the appellants even on being dispossessed without due process of law have to apply before the said department under the Land Allotment Policy, 2012, which will be considered on merit and requisite payment of salami and annual rent will have to be paid by the would be lessee.",2
126,"16) As discussed above, the registered lease deed was executed on 26th May, 2010, when the Land Allotment Policy, 2012 did not come into effect.",2
127,"For no fault of the appellants, we are unable to accept the proposal for the appellants to apply under the provisions of a guideline which was nonexistent at the date of execution of the lease deed, apart from the fact that, the appellants are not agreeable to such terms.",3
128,17) We have considered the argument advanced by the respondent nos.,1
129,1to 6 to the extent that the appellants do not have any right to remain in possession as the lease is invalid and that the said respondents have offered to refund of the lease rent received by it thereby causing no prejudice to the appellants as also justifying the dispossession due to invalidity of the lease.,1
130,"Assuming without Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67991442/ 6 Anil Gupta & Ors vs The State Of West Bengal & Ors on 28 February, 2019 admitting that the lease is invalid, then also it does not give the respondent nos.",7
131,1 to 6 the right to dispossess the appellants without observing due process of law particularly when the respondents have issued a termination notice and the lease is a registered one for 99 years.,2
132,"The dispossession of the appellants has admittedly taken place in the instant case, without observing due process of law that too during the pendency of the writ petition.",1
133,"The State or its instrumentalities cannot indulge in such an act which is per se, arbitrary and in violation of the principles of natural justice and void in law.",2
134,"The lease dated 26th May, 2010 being a registered document is governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 which specify the modalities for taking possession on the lease being terminated.",4
135,These modalities cannot be given a go bye even if it is alleged that the lease is an invalid one.,0
136,This issue requires adjudication which the writ court is not in a position to adjudicate as it requires evidence and trial.,1
137,"18) In the facts and circumstances, as aforesaid, we direct the respondent no.",1
138,"1 to 6 and the Land and Land Reforms and Refugee Reliefs and Rehabilitation Department, Government of West Bengal to restore the possession of the said plot of land as described in the schedule of the lease deed dated 26th May, 2010 to the appellants immediately, but not later than four weeks from the date of this order.",4
139,"The appellants will not alienate, encumber, part with or create any third party interest upon being restored back to possession.",0
140,"If the appellants make any improvement to the property, they will also not claim any equity.",0
141,"The respondents, however, will be at liberty to proceed against the appellants by observing due process of law in order to recover possession.",2
