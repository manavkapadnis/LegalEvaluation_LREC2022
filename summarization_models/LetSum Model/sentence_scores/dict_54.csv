240,In that case also sale was advertised twice.,1

249,One of the submissions before the Hon'ble High Court was that SIPCOT had acted in haste and hurry.,0

251,20 Lakhs on or before 31.12.1993 and a further sum of Rs.,0
252,18 Lakhs on or before 20.01.1994.,0
253,22\.,0
254,The Hon'ble Division Bench also concluded Patna High Court CWJC No.4187 of 2008 dt.15-01-2019 that the sale was not conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Apex Court in Mahesh Chandra's Case inasmuch as (i) the sale was not held by auction and was held by inviting tenders followed by negotiation; (ii) the price for which properties were sold was low and (iii) before accepting the offer of Rs.,6
255,38 Lakhs no intimation was given to respondent no.,1

258,"On a challenge made to the judgments of the Hon'ble High Court, the Hon'ble Apex Court in paragraph-12, 13 and 14 held as under: ""12.",0
259,"In the matter of sale of public property, the dominant consideration is to secure the best price for the property to be sold.",0
260,This can be achieved only when there is maximum public participation in the process of sale and every body has an opportunity of making an offer.,0
261,Public auction after adequate publicity ensures participation of every person who is interested in purchasing the property and generally secures the best price.,0
262,But many times it may not be possible to secure the best price by public auction when the bidders join together so as to depress the bid or the nature of the property to be sold is such that suitable bid many not be Patna High Court CWJC No.4187 of 2008 dt.15-01-2019 received at public auction.,3
263,"In the event, the other suitable mode for selling of property can be by inviting tenders.",0
264,"In order to ensure that such sale by calling tenders does not escape attention of an intending participant, it is essential that every endeavour should be made to give wide publicity so as to get the maximum price.",1
265,These considerations which govern the sale of public property have been held to be applicable to a sale of property by the State Financial Corporations under Section 29 of the Act in Mahesh Chandra case (1992 AIR SCW 3629) (Supra).,6
266,"In that case this Court has held that sale by public auction is universally recognized to be the best and most fair method and is beyond reproach Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162418924/ 8 M/S K.K.Glass Factory Pvt.Ltd& vs The Bihar State Financial Corp on 15 January, 2019 and, if it is not possible to adopt the said method, sale may be held by inviting tenders, but in that event every endeavour should be made to give wide publicity to get the maximum price.",9
267,"The said decision cannot, therefore, be construed as laying down that a sale by tender is impermissible and invalid.",0
268,"The learned judges, in that case, have referred to the decisions of this Court in Sachidananda Pandey v. State of West Bengal, (1987) 2 SCR 223: (AIR 1987 SC 1109) and Haji T. M. Hassan v. Kerala Patna High Court CWJC No.4187 of 2008 dt.15-01-2019 Financial Corporation, (1988) 1 SCR 1079 : (AIR 1988 SC 157) wherein it has been held that one of the modes of securing the public interest, when it is considered necessary to dispose of a property, is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders.",11

272,"In the facts and circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the failure on the part of SIPCOT to sell the property by public auction and selling it to respondent no.",2
273,2 by inviting tenders is bad for the reason that the said property has not received the best price in the market.,1
274,As indicated earlier in response to the first advertisement no offer was received from anybody and in response to the second advertisement also only one offer was received from respondent No.,1
275,2 and that too was only for Rs.,0

281,"1 had sufficient Patna High Court CWJC No.4187 of 2008 dt.15-01-2019 opportunity, during the pendency of the matter in the High Court as well as in this Court, to secure an offer higher than Rs.",3
282,38 lakhs made by respondent No.,1
283,"2, but he has not been able to bring any higher offer.",0
284,In the circumstances it cannot be said that the price at which the unit was sold was low.,0
285,The sanction of the loan of Rs.,0
286,44.80 lakhs in 1987 cannot afford a basis for holding that the value of the unit in 1993 could not be less than Rs.,6
287,44.80 lakhs.,0
288,The value of the plant and machinery could have fallen on account of its being used during the period from 1987 to 1993 or due to the same getting outdated.,6
289,If the value of the unit was higher than Rs.,1
290,38 lakhs it would have been possible for respondent No.,1
291,2 to obtain a better offer.,0
292,His failure to do so negatives the inference that the sale price of Rs.,0
293,38 lakhs is low.,0
294,"Similarly, the failure on the part of SIPCOT to give intimation to respondent No.",2
295,1 before accepting the offer of Rs.,0

300,In these circumstances no fault can be found with the action of SIPCOT in selling the unit to respondent No.,1

307,"In the present case, where the Unit was waiting for sale after second advertisement and for last 15 years, it cannot be said that wide publicity was not given to the sale notice.",1
308,In fact the judgment cited by Mr. Shrivastava would go against the petitioner in this case.,2

314,It is not the case of the petitioner that the sale notice did not mention the valuation and/or the sale amount of Rs.,3
