22,R.P.C.,0
23,"and PW-7, Dilip Kumar Das, Railway employee and expert on materials.",0
24,"There are three vital ingredients to prove commission of offence under Section 3 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 - (a) The property in question must be railway property; (b) the possession, misappropriation or theft of such property must be proved against the accused, (c) such possession must be unlawful.",6
25,"In so far as the first ingredient is concerned, I find that out of 25 Tie Bars, 2 Tie Bars were actually produced in course of trial.",1
26,"The factum of exclusive ownership of the said Tie Bars by the Railways have been proved by evidence of PW-7, Dilip Kumar Das.",0
27,He has stated in evidence that the said Tie Bars are of a nature that are only used by the Railways Engineering Department and none else.,2
28,He further deposed that such Bars are issued against confirmed indents with the Railways for its construction activities.,0
29,He further stated that such Tie Bars were never auctioned and were in good useable condition.,2
30,"Hence, the ownership of the Tie Bars stolen and removed from the exclusive possession of the Railways has been proved.",0
31,The accused Ashim Ghosh has been identified as a Biri Binder by Paltu Ghosh.,0
32,PW5.,0
33,Paltu Ghosh is himself an unemployed resident of the area concerned.,0
34,"The accused was found in terms of the evidence of PW-1 at ""the shop room and godown"" of the accused respondent.",1
35,"In his defence and statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused- respondent stated that the shop-cum- godown does not belong to him and that it belongs to one Haripada Das.",6
36,He further stated in examination under Section 313 that he was standing in front of the said shop and has noting do with the shoproom/godown or the tie bars.,4
37,The Railways have not been able to bring any evidence to show that the accused Ashim Ghosh was either the owner of the shop or was actually present inside the said shop- cum-godown.,1
38,"PW-4, who was declared hostile said he did not know whether the shop room/godown was owned by accused Ashim Ghosh.",0
39,He was declared also hostile.,0
40,He said in cross- examination that one Haripada Das was his tenant and ran a iron scrap selling ship under his tenancy.,0
41,PW-6 ASI Subas Chandra Paul stated in cross- examination that accused was not asked to produce the trade license of this shop.,2
42,"He also said that he did not enquire from the municipality as to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126200751/ 2 The State Of West Bengal vs Ashim Ghosh on 3 July, 2019 whether the accused had a trade license in respect of the said shop.",6
43,No contemporaneous evidence has either been led in the trial or obtained by the prosecution to show the exact physical presence of the accused inside the shoproom or his ownership or possession of the same.,1
44,The tie bars were not recovered from the person of the accused and no evidence is there to the effect.,0
45,"The possession of the accused in so far as the said Railway property is concerned, has not thus been established beyond reasonable doubt, by the prosecution.",0
46,"The learned Counsel for the State would argue that since it has come out from the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 and PW- 6 that the accused was present at the shop room-cum-godown, it must be deemed that he was present inside the shop room and godown and therefore had actual physical possession of the said Railway property.",2
47,Admittedly it has also not come in evidence that the accused was in fact holding any number of the said Bars within his physical possession nor was the same stated or deposed by the witnesses.,2
48,No such evidence has come on record from any of the prosecution witnesses.,0
49,The learned Counsel representing the respondent relied upon two decisions one of which this Court finds to be substantially relevant.,1
50,The said decision is in the case of Ramanand Yadav - Vs. - Prabhu Nath Jha & Ors.,5
51,reported in (2003) 12 S.C.C.,0
52,"606 at paragraph 21 of the said judgment is set out hereinbelow: ""There is no embargo on the appellate court reviewing the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based.",0
53,"Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal.",0
54,"The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted.",0
55,The paramount consideration of the Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented.,1
56,A miscarriage of justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent.,1
57,"In a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the appellate court to reappreciate the evidence in a case where the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether any of the accused committed any offence or not.",3
58,(See Bhagwan Singh - Vs. - State of M.P.).,3
59,The principle to be followed by the appellate court considering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal is to interfere only when there are compelling and substantial reasons for doing so.,1
60,"If the impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable and relevant and convincing materials have been unjustifiably eliminated in the process, it is compelling reason for interference.",0
61,"These aspects were highlighted by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade - Vs. - State of Maharashtra, Ramesh Babulal Doshi - Vs. State of Gujarat, Jaswant Singh \- Vs. - State of Haryana, Raj Kishore Jha - Vs. - State of Bihar, State of Punjab - Vs. Karnail Singh and State of Punjab - Vs. - Phola Singh.""",4
62,"Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126200751/ 3 The State Of West Bengal vs Ashim Ghosh on 3 July, 2019 Applying the aforesaid test, this Court finds that the evidence on record is such that the offense against the accused has not been proved.",6
63,"The views that the State would urge, this Court to take on such evidence, may be a remotely a plausible view but this Court has independently taken a view on the evidence on record that prosecution has not been able to establish the offence against the accused.",3
64,In any event the trial occurred in 1987 and acquittal occurred in the same year.,3
65,To reverse the finding of the Trial Court after 31 years of the acquittal in a case of the nature would even otherwise be unfair and improper.,3
66,"In those circumstances, since the second and major limb of the evidence under Section 3 of the Act of 1966 has not been proved by the prosecution, the accused-respondent was liable to be acquitted by the Court below.",6
67,"Although this Court finds that the Trial Court has not exactly addressed itself to the aforesaid issues in clear terms, this Court however finds that the conclusion reached by the Trial Court is unimpeachable and hence the accused was rightly acquitted by the Court below albeit for other reasons.",3
68,"For the reasons stated above, the appeal must fail and is hereby dismissed.",3
69,The accused is hereby set at large and the bail bond shall stand discharged.,0
70,Let a copy of this judgment be sent down the Court below for information.,0
71,"Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the parties as early as possible.",1
