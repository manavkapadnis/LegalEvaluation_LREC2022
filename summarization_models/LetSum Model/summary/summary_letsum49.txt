Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 2 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 13\.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 3 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 22\.Against this order of the High Court, the three accused persons (A−7 to A−9) have felt aggrieved and filed this appeal after obtaining the special leave to appeal in this Court.In substance, the submission was against the splitting of the charges at the appellate stage by the High Court for convicting the appellants under Section 302/34 IPC and acquitting the remaining eight co− accused persons under Section 302/149 IPC but not extending the similar benefit of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 4 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 acquittal to the appellants herein.It was, therefore, his submission that if the role of the present two appellants is examined in the commission of the crime then it is clear that the death of Mahendro Bai occurred on account of gun shot injury hit by Puran Singh (A−3) who stood acquitted and Farsa injury inflicted by Mala Singh (A−7), who has since died, and not on account of the injury caused by the present two appellants.2 and 3 could at best be convicted for an offence punishable under Section 324 IPC but not beyond it keeping in view the law laid down by this Court on such question in Mohd.Khalil Chisti vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.Lastly, it was urged that since both these appellants (A−8 & A−9) have already undergone around seven years of jail sentence and were also released on bail in the year 2009 by this Court and both still continue to be on bail for the last 10 years, the ends of justice would be met, if both the appellants are awarded the jail sentence of already undergone under Section 324 IPC with any fine amount.Mr. Karan Bharihoke, learned amicus curiae brought to our notice the legal position, which apply in this case and argued ably by pointing out the evidence and how the legal principle laid down by this Court apply to the case at hand.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 6 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 386\.(1) No finding, sentence or order by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the ground of any error, omission or Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 7 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 irregularity in the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in the opinion of the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.The Constitution Bench of this Court examined this issue, for the first time, in the context of old Criminal Procedure Code in a case reported in Willie (William) Slaney vs. State of M.P.In Kantilal Chandulal Mehta vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr.(1969) 3 SCC 166, this Court again examined this very issue arising under the present Code of Criminal Procedure with which we are concerned in the present case.Now coming to the question regarding altering of the charge from Section 149 to Section 34 IPC read with Section 302 IPC, this question was considered by this Court for the first time in the case of Lachhman Singh & Ors.vs.This question was again examined by this Court in Karnail Singh & Anr.vs. State of Punjab (AIR 1954 SC 204) wherein the learned Judge Venkatarama Ayyar,J.The following observations of this court in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 364 were relied on in support of this position :− "Nor is it possible in this case to have recourse to section 34 because the appellants have not been charged with that even in the alternative and the common intention required by section 34 and the common object required by section 149 are far from being the same thing."It is true that there is substantial difference between the two sections but as observed by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. Emperor, AIR 1925 PC 1, they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case whether the charge under section 149 overlaps the ground covered by section 34.But if the facts to be proved and the evidence to be adduced with reference to the charge under section 149 would be the same 'if the charge were under section 34, then the failure to charge the accused under section 34 could not result in any prejudice and in such cases, the substitution of section 34 for section 149 must be held to be a formal matter.We do not read the observations in Dalip Singh v. State, of Punjab(1) as an authority for the broad proposition that in law there could be no recourse to, section 34 when the charge is only under section 149.This is in accord with the view taken by this court in Lachhman Singh v. The State (1), where the substitution of section 34 for section 149 was upheld on the ground that the facts were such that the accused could have been charged alternatively either under section 302 read with section 149, or Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 9 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 under section 302read with section 34\.In Lachman Singh v. The State, AIR 1952 SC 167, it was held that when there is a charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 149 and the charge under section 149 disappears because of the acquittal of some of the accused, a conviction under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 34is good even though there is no separate charge under section 302 read with section 34, provided the accused could have been so charged on the facts of the case.This principle of law was then reiterated after referring to law laid down in Willie (William) Slaney (Supra) in the case reported in Chittarmal vs. State of Rajasthan (2003) 2 SCC 266 in the following words: 14\.Thus, if several persons numbering five or more, do an act and intend to do it, both sections 34 and section 149 may apply.The non applicability of section 149 is, therefore, no bar in convicting the appellants under section 302 read with section 34 IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of an offence in furtherance of the common intention of them all.Second, keeping in view the law laid down by this Court in the cases referred supra, the High Court though had the jurisdiction to alter the charge from Section 149 IPC to Section 34 IPC qua the three appellants, yet, in our view, in the absence of any evidence of common intention qua the three appellants so as to bring their case within the net of Section 34 IPC, their conviction under Section 302/34 IPC is not legally sustainable.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 11 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 59\.Parihar) Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 12 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 68\.2 and 3 has already undergone around seven years of jail sentence when both were released on bail by orders of this Court on 07.07.2009.Taking into consideration the fact that the appellants Nos.Before parting, we place on record a word of appreciation for the valuable services rendered by Mr. Karan Bharihoke amicus curiae appointed by this Court.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 13 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 ..J.
