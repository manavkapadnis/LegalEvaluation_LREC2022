(3) The prosecution examined nineteen (19) witnesses, out of whom PW5, PW6, and PW13 are Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8596893/ 1 Ranjan Karmakar vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 September, 2019 eye-witnesses.Culpable homicide.--Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide."(9) Section 300 IPC provides that except in the cases mentioned in the exceptions to that Section, culpable homicide is murder if: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8596893/ 2 Ranjan Karmakar vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 September, 2019 i.The act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or ii.The person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.The said exception is subject to two provisos which are not presently germane for us.However, the Explanation to the said Exception states that whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.The Explanation to this Exception says that it is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.Hence, the appellant's act amounted to murder under the fourth limb of Section 300 IPC.That is why we say that provocation for committing the offending act in the heat of the moment cannot be ruled out.It was definitely an irresponsible and rash act on his part.Even if it was done under provocation or in the heat of the moment, such an act is not acceptable and is culpable and deprecable.(17) Further, when a person has a plan to kill someone, it is normal human conduct that he would execute such plan inasmuch as surreptitious, secretive and clandestine a manner as is possible so as to eliminate the possibility of having an eye-witness to such an act.When a person opens fire on another person in the heat of the moment, it is highly unlikely that the consequence of such an act plays in his mind.In such a situation, the offender would not normally weigh the pros and cons or the consequences of the act of shooting and then commit the act.It would ordinarily be an impulsive act done in a fit of rage which would momentarily eclipse the normal logical thought process of the offender.5000 on the appellant and in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8596893/ 4 Ranjan Karmakar vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 September, 2019 further six months for the offence under Section 304 IPC.
