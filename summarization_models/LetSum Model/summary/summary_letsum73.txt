Vidyanadam & ors.vs. Vairavan, 1997 (3) SCC 1, has been noticed at paragraph 37 of the judgment but does not find any consideration.In support of his submissions, Dr. Singhvi relied on Wander Ltd. and another vs. Antox India P. Ltd., 1990 Suppl.SCC 727, Brij Mohan and others vs. Sugra Begum and ors., (1990) 4 SCC 147, Motilal Jain vs. Ramdasi Devi (Smt.)), Faridkot vs. Baldev Dass, (2004) 8 SCC 488, and Aloka Bose vs. Parmatma Devi and ors., (2009) 2 SCC 582.On the aspect of the delay in institution of the suit, relying on Mademsetty Satyanarayana vs. G. Yelloji Rao and ors., 1965 (2) SCR 221, it was submitted that the delay did not induce the 9 defendant to do anything further than that already done earlier, to their prejudice.Chapter VII, Section 36 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) provides for grant of preventive relief.The cardinal principles for grant of temporary injunction were considered in Dalpat Kumar vs. Prahlad Singh, (1992) 1 SCC 719, observing as follows : “5…Satisfaction that there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction.The fact that a draft MoU christened as ‘final­for discussion’ was sent the same day cannot lead to the inference in isolation, of a concluded contract.The prolonged negotiations between the parties reflect that matters were still at the ‘embryo stage’ as observed in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, Gondal and ors.vs. Girdharbhai Ramjibhai Chhaniyara and ors., (1997) 5 SCC 468.In a matter concerning grant of injunction, apart from the existence of a prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable injury, the conduct of the party seeking the equitable relief of injunction is also very essential to be considered as observed in Motilal Jain (supra) holding as follows : “6.The question of irreparable harm to a party complaining of a breach of contract does not arise if other remedies are available to the party complaining of the breach.Mathur vs. DTC, (2006) 13 SCC 706, this Court observed : “14.It fell for consideration again in Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. vs. Coca Cola Co., (1995) 5 SCC 545, observing as follows : “47….Under Order 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure, jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with an order of interlocutory or temporary injunction is purely equitable and, therefore, the Court, on being approached, will, apart from other considerations, also look to the conduct of the party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court, and may refuse to interfere unless his conduct was free from blame.
