During the subsistence of the contract, the prices of HighÂ­ Speed Diesel (â€œHSDâ€), one of the essential materials for carrying out the drilling operations, increased.If two views are possible on a question of law, the High Court cannot substitute one view and deference should be given to the plausible view of the Arbitral Tribunal.Learned counsel has relied upon a judgment of this Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [(2006) 11 SCC 181] to support his contention.c. The question of law decided by the Arbitral Tribunal is beyond judicial review and thus the High Court could not have interfered with a reasoned award which was neither against public policy of India nor patently illegal.In order to answer the questions raised in this appeal we first need to delve into the ambit and scope of the courtâ€™s jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.Section 34 of the Arbitration Act provides as under â€“ 34\.Explanation.Recently, this Court in Dyna Technologies Pvt.Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [2019 SCC Online SC 1656] laid down the scope of such interference.This Court observed as followsÂ­ â€œ26.There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts.We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral 8 awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award.This Court in Dyna Technologies (supra) observed as underÂ­ â€œ27.Section 56 of the Contract Act stands as follows: 56\.Agreement to do impossible act.â€”An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.Contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawfulâ€”A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.When the parties have not provided for what would take place when an event which renders the performance of the contract impossible, then Section 56 of the Contract Act applies.As held by this Court in Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co., AIR 1954 SC 44: â€œ15.These differences in the way of formulating legal theories really do not concern us so long as we have a statutory provision in the Indian Contract Act.In deciding cases in India the only doctrine that we have to go by is that of supervening impossibility or illegality as laid down in Section 56 of the Contract Act, taking the word â€œimpossibleâ€ in its practical and not literal sense.This formulation was overÂ­ruled by the House of Lords in the historic decision of Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd., [1942] UKHL 4, wherein the harsh consequences of frustration as per the old doctrine was moderated by the introduction of the law of restitution.Interestingly, (Shipbuilding Shaw in Cantiare Company) v. Clyde Lord San Rocco Shipbuilding SA and Engineering Co. Ltd., [1924] AC 226, had observed that English law of leaving the loss to where it fell unless the contract provided otherwise was, he said, appropriate only 16 â€˜among tricksters, gamblers and thievesâ€™.In India, the Contract Act had already recognized the harsh consequences of such frustration to some extent and had provided for a limited mechanism to ameliorate the same under Section 65 of the Contract Act.We are cognizant that the aforesaid provision addresses limited circumstances wherein an agreement is void ab initio or the contract becomes subsequently void.Our attention was drawn to Sumitomo Heavy Industries Limited v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, (2010) 11 SCC 296, where this Court interpreted an indemnity clause and found that an additional tax burden could be recovered under such clause.
