vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 Supreme Court of India Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr.LRS.& ANOTHER Appellants VERSUS SHIVNATH & OTHERS Respondents JUDGMENT R. BANUMATHI, J.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 wrongly issued by illaqedar in the name of Gaya Din and the proceedings for cancellation of the records in the name of Gaya Din be initiated.The impugned judgment of the High Court is the concurrent finding of the High Court and the first Appellate Court.When the finding of the first Appellate court and the High Court are shown to be perverse, this Court would certainly interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the High Court.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 at the time of settlement and the predecessors of respondents-plaintiffs have not cultivated the lands.Placing reliance upon Nagindas Ramdas v. Dalpatram Iccharam alias Brijram and others (1974) 1 SCC 242 and Executive Officer, Arulmigu Chokkanatha Swamy Koil Trust, Virudhunagar v. Chandran and others (2017) 3 SCC 702, it was submitted that in view of clear admission of grant of lease in the name of father of respondents- plaintiffs, the said admitted fact need not be proved.However, proviso to Section 58 of the Evidence Act gives full discretion to the court to require the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58175470/ 4 Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 18\.Section 90 of the Evidence Act enables the court to draw presumption about the genuineness of the document which is thirty years old.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 23\.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 order of Tahsildar dated 28.07.1971, the mischief of patwari was proved beyond shadow of doubt.The real fact is that the respondents-plaintiffs did challenge various orders passed by the revenue authorities before the concerned authorities and lost.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 Tahsildar dated 01.09.1962, order of Tahsildar dated 28.07.1971 and order of Collector dated 21.11.1972.In support of his contention, the learned senior counsel relied upon Karewwa and others v. Hussensab Khansaheb Wajantri and others (2002) 10 SCC 315 and Roop Chand v. Gopi Chand Thelia (1989) 2 SCC 383 and other decisions.In Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin & Another, (2012) 8 SCC 148, this Court held as under:Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58175470/ 9 Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 36\.Similarly, where a party on whom the onus of proving a certain point lies fails to discharge the onus, he is not entitled to a fresh opportunity to produce evidence, as the court can, in such a case, pronounce judgment against him and does not require any additional evidence to enable it to pronounce judgment.(Vide Haji Mohammed Ishaq v. Mohd.The mere fact that certain evidence is important, is not in itself a sufficient ground for admitting that evidence in appeal.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 9\.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 the Courts below and now only produced as additional evidence.Since we considered the matter at length on merits, we are not inclined to go into the question of limitation.Section 2 of the Rewa Act repealed all earlier government notices, rules, circulars, orders, notifications etc.Thus, the action taken thereunder the said Act like grant of patta etc.It is also their case that Section 3 of the Rewa Act saved the existing proceedings and the fathers of the respondents could have proceeded against the appellants under Sections 46 and 142 of the Rewa Act.However, they have not initiated any proceedings under the said provisions of the Act.The learned senior counsel for the respondents-plaintiffs submitted that upon consideration of the evidence of Hanuman Din (DW-1), the first appellate court recorded a finding of fact that in the year 1954, patta was granted in favour of Gaya Din (defendants father) and as per the testimony of Hanuman Din (DW-1), when patta was issued, Hanuman Din was 35 years old.The first appellate court arrived at such a finding without proper facts and by drawing an inference noting that when DW-1 was examined in 1984, he was aged 65 years from which the first Appellate Court inferred that Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58175470/ 13 Jagdish Prasad Patel(D) Thr.In this regard, the learned senior counsel for the respondents-plaintiffs submitted that as per Section 5 of the Vindhya Pradesh Act, all the Jagir Lands were resumed in the then Vindhya Pradesh Government on 23.06.1953, hence, on this date, Pawaidar/iIlaqedar/Jagirdar were not authorised and were not having jurisdiction to issue patta and therefore, the finding of the first appellate court that the patta issued in the name of Gaya Din in the year 1954 is not a valid one and the said findings of fact cannot be interfered with.The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants has drawn our attention to the provisions of Vindhya Pradesh Act and submitted that as per Section 5 of the said Act, the State Government by a notification appointed a date for the resumption of any class of Jagir Lands and the consequences of such resumption are set out in Section 6 of the said Act.(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) every person who is entered in the revenue record for a continuous period of three years as an occupant of any Jagir-land at the date of resumption, shall be deemed to be pattedar tenant in respect of such land which shall be assessed at the village rate.vs Shivnath on 9 April, 2019 Appellate Court, in our view, was not right in doubting the correctness of Ex.Observing that in a suit for declaration of title, the plaintiffsrespondents are to succeed only on the strength of their own title irrespective of whether the defendants-appellants have proved their case or not, in Union of India and others v. Vasavi Cooperative Housing Society Limited and others (2014) 2 SCC 269, it was held as under:15.
