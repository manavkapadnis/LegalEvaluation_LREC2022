Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 1 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 4\.and Section 27 of the Arms Act.One Ramnandan Dusadh also having died during pendency of the appeal before the High Court, the three surviving accused are in the appeal before this Court.It is submitted that the mere fact that PW11 and PW13 are related to the deceased does not in any manner impeach their truthfulness.The mere fact that deceased was brother of the informant and PW13 is the husband of the niece of the deceased and does not impeach their evidence in any manner.The mere fact that witness is related does not lead to inference that such witness is an interested witness.This Court has occasion to consider such submission in number of cases.In Kartik Malhar Vs. State of Bihar, (1996) 1 SCC 614, this Court held that a close relative who is a very natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness.15 and 16, following was laid down:15.In Dalbir Kaur (Mst) v. State of Punjab, (1976) 4 SCC 158, it has been observed as under: (SCC pp.It is true, when feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there is tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth.Our observations are only made to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 3 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 combat what is so often put forward in cases before us as a general rule of prudence.Further in Namdeo Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2007) 14 SCC 150, same propositions were reiterated by this court elaborately referring to the earlier judgments, this Court rejected the same submission in paragraph Nos.Before more than half a century, in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 364, a similar question came up for consideration before this Court.In that case, the High Court observed that testimony of two eyewitnesses required corroboration since they were closely related to the deceased.Referring to an earlier decision in Rameshwar Kalyan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1952 SC 54, Their Lordships observed that it was a fallacy common to many criminal cases and in spite of endeavours to dispel, it unfortunately still persists, if not in the judgments of the courts, at any rate in the arguments of counsel (Dalip Singh case, AIR p. 366, para 25).It is true that in his statement, he mentioned names of only four persons, who Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 4 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 were seen fleeing on Rouza Road.The mere fact that he did not mention name of Ram Pravesh Dubey cannot lead to the inference that Ram Pravesh Dubey was not involved in the incident.The mere fact that PW5 did not see Ram Pravesh Dubey fleeing is not conclusive nor on that basis, we can come to any inference that Ram Pravesh Dubey was not involved in the occurrence.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 5 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 (v) Lacerated cut ½" x ½" left margin of tongue with blood clot in the mouth.The accused were suspicious of the fact that my deceased brother had got him jailed.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193977664/ 6 Shio Shankar Dubey vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2019 19\.( ASHOK BHUSHAN ) ......................J.( K.M.
