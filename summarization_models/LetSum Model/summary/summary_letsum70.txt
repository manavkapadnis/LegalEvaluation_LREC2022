Inspector Hiralal Chaudhary (PWÂ­1) testified to the search of Sharma, the seizure of a sum of Rs 10,780 from his person, and the lack of any explanation by him on the spot regarding source of the suspicious sum.Further, he claimed that Sharma was repeatedly trying to get in touch with the appellant, but could only get through at around 7PM and then informed him that he was caught carrying his own money.It was noted that not only had proper opportunity of crossÂ­examining witnesses and of availing assistance been accorded to the appellant, but that sufficient opportunities of seeking explanations, clarifications and records of testimonies and documents had in fact also been availed of by him.Keeping in mind the nature of the allegations which entailed surreptitious corruption amongst members of the paramilitary, the disciplinary authority observed that it was unlikely that there would be independent witnesses to many incidents like the charge of intimidating KK Sharma (PWÂ­2) to give false testimony, or of collecting bribe from BPCLâ€™s contractors.The contentions made in his appeal petitions are totally devoid of merits both in fact and in law.Finally, the appellant sought leniency and urged that given another 21 years of remaining service, imposition of the severest punishment of dismissal from service was highly disproportionate which ought to shock the conscience of this Court.The ratio of Shashi Prasad v. CISF1 was distilled to drive home the argument that departmental enquiries donâ€™t stand on the same pedestal as criminal proceedings.2 2006 2 SCC 373. v. Mohd Nasrulla Khan 2, and that Page | 13 Constitutional Courts ought not to act as appellate authorities against disciplinary proceedings of government employees.Judicial Review seeks to ensure fairness in treatment and not fairness of conclusion.It ought to be used to correct manifest errors of law or procedure, which might result in significant injustice; or in case of bias or gross unreasonableness of outcome.3 26\.These principles are succinctly elucidated by a threeÂ­judge Bench of this Court in BC Chaturvedi v. Union of India4 in the following extract: â€œ12.Power of judicial review is meant to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion which the authority reaches is necessarily correct in the eye of the court.Whether the findings or conclusions are based on some evidence, the authority entrusted with the power to hold inquiry has jurisdiction, power and authority to reach a finding of fact or conclusion.But that finding must be based on some evidence.Neither the technical rules of Evidence Act nor of proof of fact or evidence as defined therein, apply to disciplinary proceeding.When the authority accepts that evidence and conclusion receives support therefrom, the disciplinary authority is entitled to hold that the delinquent officer is guilty of the charge.Page | 15 power of judicial review does not act as appellate authority to reappreciate the evidence and to arrive at its own independent findings on the evidence.The Court/Tribunal may interfere where the authority held the proceedings against the delinquent officer in a manner inconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in violation of statutory rules prescribing the mode of inquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by the disciplinary authority is based on no evidence.If the conclusion or finding be such as no reasonable person would have ever reached, the Court/Tribunal may interfere with the conclusion or the finding, and mould the relief so as to make it appropriate to the facts of each case.In Union of India v. H.C. Goel [(1964) 4 SCR 718 : AIR 1964 SC 364 : (1964) 1 LLJ 38] this Court held at p. 728 that if the conclusion, upon consideration of the evidence reached by the disciplinary authority, is perverse or suffers from patent error on the face of the record or based on no evidence at all, a writ of certiorari could be issued.â€ 27\.These parameters have been consistently reiterated by this Court in a catena of decisions, including: (i) (ii) (iii) State of Tamil Nadu v. S Subramaniam, (1996) 7 SCC 509.Lalit Popli v. Canara Bank, (2003) 3 SCC 583.Their jurisdiction is circumscribed by limits of correcting errors of law, procedural errors leading to manifest injustice or violation of principles of natural justice.The conclusion obtained was based upon these very evidences and was detailed and wellÂ­ reasoned.Furthermore, the High Court didnâ€™t restrict the scope of judicial review, rather adopted a liberal approach, and delved further to come to its own independent conclusion of guilt.5 The record clearly elucidates that all these essentials had been duly observed in the present proceedings.Effect of criminal enquiry on disciplinary proceedings The incident of 28.02.1999 raised serious questions of criminality under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of 5 Union of India v. T.R.7 6 Karnataka SRTC v. MG Vittal Rao, (2012) 1 SCC 442, Â¶ 11.7 Ajit Kumar Nag v. Indian Oil Corp Ltd (2005) 7 SCC 764, Â¶ 11.Determination of such proportionality is a function of not only the action or intention of the delinquent, but must also factor the financial effect and societal implication of such misconduct.9 But unlike in criminal cases, in matters of disciplinary 8 BHEL v.
