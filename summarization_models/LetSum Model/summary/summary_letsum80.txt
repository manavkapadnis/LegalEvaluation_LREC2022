6319 OF 2009 PATRAM â€¦APPELLANT(S) Versus GRAM PANCHAYAT KATWAR & ORS.The land in question is situated in Haryana and, therefore, for the purpose of this judgment we shall be referring to the Act as amended and applicable to the State of Haryana.The following observations from Chapter X, which has the heading â€˜The Village Common Land Introductionâ€™ of Sir W.H.This brings us to the definition of â€˜shamilat dehâ€™ in Section 2(g) of the Act.becomes or has become shamilat deh due to river action or has been reserved as shamilat in villages subject to river action except shamilat deh entered as pasture, pond or playground in the revenue xxx xxx xxx is described in the revenue records as shamilat taraf, pattis, pannas and thola and not used according to revenue records for the benefit of the village community or a part thereof or for common purposes the village; xxx xxx xxx The case of the appellant(s) is that for more than a century he and his ancestors held a patti which has never been used for the common purpose of the village and has been cultivated by them.The earlier entries in the column of ownership which read as â€˜Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubiâ€™ were replaced by the entry â€˜Panchayat Dehâ€™.Whereas, the exception under clause (v) of the proviso under section 2(g) of the Act notices, â€œshamlat tarafâ€, â€œpattisâ€, â€œpannasâ€ and â€œtholaâ€ as falling with the exception.The definition of â€˜shamilat dehâ€™ in Section 2(g) of the Act includes all lands descried as â€˜shamilat dehâ€™ or charand excluding abadi land.Keeping in view, what we have held above, it appears to us that the absence of a comma is a mistake and in fact according to us, a comma should be read after â€˜shamilatâ€™ and before â€˜tarafâ€™ in the latter part of the section also.From the revenue records produced, we find that the land has been shown as â€˜Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubiâ€™.â€˜Dhera & Khubiâ€™ are the ancestors of the appellant(s).The land was always shown to be â€˜Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubiâ€™ and in the cultivation of the appellant(s) or his ancestors.
