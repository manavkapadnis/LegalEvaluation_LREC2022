... on 20 June, 2019 Bombay High Court Mohan Maroti Jadhav (In Jail) vs The State Of Maharashtra, Thr.\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CORAM : P.N.DESHMUKH & MRS. PUSHPA V. GANEDIWALA, JJ.JUDGMENT : (PER PUSHPA V. GANEDIWALA, J.)The prosecution story, in brief, is as under:- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54221007/ 1 Mohan Maroti Jadhav (In Jail) vs The State Of Maharashtra, Thr.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54221007/ 2 Mohan Maroti Jadhav (In Jail) vs The State Of Maharashtra, Thr.However, the material on record is not sufficient to connect the accused to the alleged crime and to draw a conclusion that the accused only and no other person has committed murder of Zimibai.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54221007/ 3 Mohan Maroti Jadhav (In Jail) vs The State Of Maharashtra, Thr.In our opinion, such a presumption without any base of law is totally erroneous.(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established; (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; Cri.Appeal 362 of 16.odt (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else, and (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation on any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence."In such circumstances, there is no question of Zimibai going towards the Nala site and accused following her.Even, he can not be termed as thief by applying presumption under section 114 of the Evidence Act.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54221007/ 5 Mohan Maroti Jadhav (In Jail) vs The State Of Maharashtra, Thr.Even if the cash is not recovered from the accused Cri.Appeal 362 of 16.odt there is no evidence to show what did the accused do with the said cash allegedly received by him.Nothing on record to show that the place of incident was an isolated place, possible to commit such an act.It is the cardinal principle of law that the best evidence should come before the Court.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54221007/ 6 Mohan Maroti Jadhav (In Jail) vs The State Of Maharashtra, Thr.
