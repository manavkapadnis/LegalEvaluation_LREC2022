BASNETT (D) Through LRs â€¦ Appellant versus THE COLLECTOR East District, Gangtok, Sikkim & Anr.The consideration of merits was based on the fact that the original stamped receipts of payment of compensation had been taken note of in the record of proceedings, though the actual receipt was not available.It is also recorded that no notification under the said Act 4 had been produced, nor was any record produced in that behalf.It was observed that this was the least expected considering that the respondents claimed to have lost all records of acquisition proceedings and none of the notifications were available.Be that as it may, the fact remains, as noticed by the High Court, that it is not the case of the respondents that they had adverse possession, but that they had acquired the land through due process and had paid compensation for the same.That brings us to the question whether the process of acquisition 7 had been followed in accordance with law.This letter does not obviate the need to furnish proof of the process for acquisition of land or for the determination of compensation, 8 under the said Act.Padmamma & Ors.v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy &Ors.It is also settled law that following the procedure of Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 18942 (akin to Section 5(1) of the said Act) is mandatory, and unless that notice is given in accordance with the provisions contained therein, the entire acquisition proceeding would be vitiated.3Narinderjit Singh & Ranjit Singh & Ors.The right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by the Constitution (Forty Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, however, it continued to be a human right (Tukaram Kana Joshi & Ors.v. M.I.D.C.& Ors.Article 300 A provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.The provisions of the Act seeking to divest such right, keeping in view of the provisions of Article 300A of the Constitution of India, must be strictly construed.â€ (emphasis originally supplied) In Delhi Airtech Services Pvt.Ltd. & Ors.(2011) 9 SCC 354, this Court recognized the right to property as a basic human right in the following words: â€œ30.1 SCC 596 this Court held as follows: â€œ48.â€¦In other words, Article 300A only limits the powers of the State that no person shall be deprived of his property 12 save by authority of law.There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law.In a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, the State could not have deprived a citizen of their property without the sanction of law.Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi &Ors.; v. M.I.D.C.This Court in State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar held that the right to property is now considered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right, but also a human right.In a case where the demand for justice is so compelling, a constitutional Court would exercise its jurisdiction with a view to promote justice, and not defeat it (P.S.; (2013) 1 SCC 353, this Court while dealing with a similar fact situation, held as follows: â€œThere are authorities which state that delay and laches extinguish the right to put forth a claim.Functionaries of the State took over possession of the land belonging to the Appellants without any sanction of law.We are strengthened in our observations on account of the judgment of this Court in LAO v. M. Ramakrishna Reddy,5 where it was held that the owner can be entitled to damages for wrongful use and possession of land in respect of which no notification is issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, from the date of possession till the date such notification is finally published.In either eventuality, the question of payment for use and occupation would still arise, which will have to be determined in accordance with law.
