The appellant before this Court has been convicted by Special Court designated at the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, on 29.10.2005, for offence punishable under Section 7, 13 (1) (b) read with Section 13(2) of the above Act.For offence under Section 13(1)(b) read with Section 13(2) is sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment for three years, to pay Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 1 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 fine of Rs.PW-3 has merely signed the proposed draft for grant of sanction sent by Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) and this act shows total non- application of mind.He relies upon judgment of this Court in the matter of Nishikant Bhaskarrao Kulkarni since deceased) through his Legal Heirs (Dr.) & Ors.Without prejudice and in the alternative, learned counsel contends that evidence of PW-1, Complaint & PW-2 Shadow witness and the two officers of the Anti Corruption Bureau is mutually inconsistent and therefore cast a cloud of doubt on entire prosecution version, he states that charge was framed by the Trial Court vide Exhibit No.Judgment 4 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 2 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 8\.23, Panchanama (Part-1) began and its conclusion all show that the authorities colluded together to prepare false documents.Learned counsel submits that when envelope was already opened and 8 notes were taken out, there is no question of its being reopened during evidence of Investigating Officer Shri Kanhaiya Sinha.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 3 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 Judgment 6 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Evidence of PW-6 Ashok Pohankar shows that he was dealing with marriage advance cases and charge was not given to accused at all.24 & 25 needs to be discarded as they do not inspire confidence at all.However, this fact is also not proved on record.Learned counsel places reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2015)10 SCC 152 in the matter of P. Satyanarayana Murthy Vs. District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra Pradesh and anr.12 is not decisive, PW-2 Devrao Maudekar was called in CBI Office at 10:00 a.m. and this Judgment 8 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 4 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt assertion by him on oath, cannot be lost sight of.He cannot therefore take advantage of the fact that seizure memo has not been exhibited.She points out that fact of seizure is brought on record sufficiently in evidence of PW-4Birader Sinha.According to her, note- sheets show delaying tactics and the documents demonstrate that though pay order/cheque was ready, it was not made over to complaint deliberately & he Judgment 9 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt got that cheque two to three days after the trap.Vs. State of M.P.Judgment of this Court in case of Nishikant Bhaskarrao Kulkani Vs. State of Maharashtra (cited supra) looks Judgment 10 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt into this aspect in paragraph 12.In that paragraph, judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (1997) 7 SCC 622 Mansukhlal Vitthaldas Chavhan Vs. State of Gujrat has been relied upon.This judgment shows that sanction cannot be granted without proper application of mind and public interest as also protection available to public servant need to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 5 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 be kept in mind.In facts before it, this Court has observed that Municipal Council had exercised advisory jurisdiction by passing a resolution that accused No.This Court found that material on record was in-sufficient to show proper application of mind and the authority treated grant of sanction as an idle formality.12 by complainant, fact of trap, successful completion thereof, drawing of Panchanama (Part-1), accused and complainant leaving office complex and going to residential quarters, the raiding party catching accused red handed, the effect of hand-wash test and seizure of currency Judgment 11 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt notes as also shirt of accused.This authority in examination-in-chief has pointed out that it received papers, went through it, applied mind and came to the conclusion prima facie that bribe was accepted.The fact that draft sanction order was sent by CBI is also not mentioned in sanction order.The error noticed by this Court in its reported judgment (cited supra) does not exist in this matter.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 6 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 29\.24 & 25 derogates from transparency and vitiates the entire exercise.This Panchanama is duly proved by the prosecution and crossJudgment 13 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt examination does not bring on record the fact that it has been falsely prepared.After this process is over Panchanama (Part-2) mentions search of table drawer of accused in his office, seizure of documents relating to Provident Fund advance of Keshavrao and a fact that a seizure memo was drawn.This Panchanama Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 7 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 (Part-2) is signed by Shri Maudekar and Shri Pendhari.Accused has not given any specific suggestion to bring on record, the fact that Shri Maudekar and Shri Pendhari were also not present in the office at that time.This entry, therefore, brings on record the fact that appellant/accused was the dealing clerk.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 8 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 38\.Fact that the accused had called complainant at 11:00 a.m. in the office, already appears in Exh.accused, one Bawankar & two-three ladies were working in Judgment 17 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt the office.Fact that he got actual disbursement after raid is also brought on record.There is Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 9 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 absolutely no reason for shadow witness Shri Devrao Maudekar (PW-2) to depose falsely against accused.The perusal of provisions of Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, shows that it prescribes a presumption where public servant accepts any undue advantage.Reliance by accused on judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of P. Satyanarayana Murthy Vs. District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra Pradesh and anr.The judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Baldev Singh Vs. State of Harayana, reported in (2015)17 SCC 554 is cited by respondent to submit that deposition of witnesses recorded in official capacity cannot be labelled as unworthy as he is interested evidence.It is observed that merely because of his position as police officer, his evidence cannot be discarded , Hon'ble Apex Court, however, has clarified that prudence required careful scrutiny & independent appreciation of such evidence.Reliance by accused on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Vinod Kumar Vs. State of Punjab, reported in (2015)3 SCC 220 is more apt.Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Girja Prasad (Dead) By LRS Vs. State of M.P., reported in (2007)7 SCC 625 deals with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.The recent judgment, reported in (2018)9 SCC 242 - State of Gujrat Vs. Navinbhai Chandrakant Joshi and Others deals with the Judgment 20 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt provisions of Section 20 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and it is observed that once possestion of bribe money is established, burden shifts to accused to rebut it and standard to be applied is of preponderance of probabilities.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/ 10 Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019 During arguments, it could be noticed that efforts were made to point out how there is variance even in the process of given signal.In this situation, I am inclined to continue the bail orders passed by this Court on 24.11.2005.
609 OF 2015 Ravindra s/o Marotrao Thakre About 44 years, Occ.The appeal is being heard since last about two days.This Court has admitted the appeal on 24.11.2005, and allowed Criminal Application No.Admittedly as per this witness, marriage of his daughter was already performed on scheduled date in May 1996 only.However, thereafter, he incorrectly and falsely represented that the marriage of his daughter was postponed initially to 27th August, 1996, and thereafter pointed out that it was postponed to 10th October, 1996.He contends that the appellant/accused has denied the entire episode and as such, the conviction needs to be quashed and set aside.The contention that marriage had taken place in May 1996 itself has got no bearing on the controversy.48 - Pay Order register clearly show that appellant/accused was associated with loan case of complainant.The order of sanction ex facie must disclosed that sanctioning authority had considered such material.In paragraph 19 full and careful examination of material in regard to allegations against accused and of circumstances of the case is also mentioned.The necessary documents showing involvement or connection of accused with the loan case of complainant were already produced by PW-3 Shri Das.The fact that initial loan application was moved sometime in May 1996 is not in dispute, fact that loan was ultimately received by complaint two or three days after actual raid is also not in dispute.Fact that marriage was already over in May 1996 is brought on record by accused in cross-examination of complaint.Claim Register for October 1996 and Pay Order Register for that month are not in dispute.Witness Shri Ashok Judgment 15 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Pohankar (PW-6) has deposed that entries for October 1996 in pay order register are written by accused.There is no substance in the appeal.Appeal is accordingly dismissed.The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
