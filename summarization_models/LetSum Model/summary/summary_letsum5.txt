De ....Advocates For the State : Mr. Neguive Ahmed Mr. A. Hossain Mr. N. P. Agarwala .....Advocates : 18.06.2019 Heard lastly on Judgment on Jay Sengupta, J. : 03.07.2019 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46753019/ 1 Mathur @ Mathura Mondal vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 July, 2019 1\.On this, reliance was placed on Devendra Nath Srivastava vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2017) 5 SCC 769, K. Ravi Kumar vs. State of Karnataka (2015) Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46753019/ 3 Mathur @ Mathura Mondal vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 July, 2019 2 SCC 638 and State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Abdul Latif, (2018) 2 CCrLR (SC) 233.But, he went on to repeat the act on his daughter with whom he did not have any dispute.Reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in Virsa Singh, vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1958 SC 465.Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46753019/ 4 Mathur @ Mathura Mondal vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 July, 2019 Extra-judicial confession: 11\.Although the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46753019/ 5 Mathur @ Mathura Mondal vs The State Of West Bengal on 3 July, 2019 preceding quarrel in a way acted as a mitigating factor, there were too many aggravating circumstances to deal with.Here two murders were committed, one after the other and the sequence of events do not permit giving any benefit of doubt to the appellant even on the question of scaling it down to Section 304, Part I of the Penal Code.
This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction dated 20.03.2008 and sentence dated 24.03.2008 passed by the Learned Additional Sessions Judge, 1st Fast Track Court, Arambagh, Hooghly in ST Case No.The defence case was primarily a denial of the prosecution case.From a careful perusal of the evidence on record, it appears that PW 1 was the de facto complainant of the case.PW 17 was the Investigating Officer of the case.The case at hand is quite different.In view of the convincing eye-witness account, the supportive medical evidence and the corroborative post-occurrence accounts, we hold that the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts.In view of the above, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the judgment and order of conviction and sentence.
