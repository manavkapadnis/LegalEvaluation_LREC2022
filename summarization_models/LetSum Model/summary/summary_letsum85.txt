The learned Senior counsel inter alia submitted that in violation of the principles laid down in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration and Others (1978) 4 SCC 494, the petitioner had been kept in solitary confinement and this aspect has not been taken into consideration.The learned Solicitor General submitted that all the guidelines laid down in Shatrughan Chauhan and other judgments have been substantially complied with.This Court, in numerous instances, clarified that the executive 8 is not sitting as a court of appeal, rather the power of President/Governor to grant remission of sentence is an act of grace and humanity in appropriate cases i.e.In Shatrughan Chauhan, it was held as under:- 9 â€œ22.In Epuru Sudhakar and Another v. Govt.and Others (2006) 8 SCC 161, it was held as under:â€œ34.It is the consistent view taken by this Court that the exercise of power of judicial review of the decision taken by the President of India on mercy petition is very limited and the same can be subject to challenge only on the following grounds:(a) that the order has been passed without application of mind; (b) that the order is mala fide; (c) that the order has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; (d) that relevant materials have been kept out of consideration; and (e) that the order suffers from arbitrariness.It was submitted that all the relevant documents and materials as laid down in Shatrughan Chauhan case and other judgments ought to have been placed before the President of India.Considering the question as to the relevant documents to be placed before the President of India and after referring to Epuru Sudhakar v. State of A.P.(2006) 8 SCC 161, this Court held thus: â€¦â€¦.. 35\.Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has inter alia submitted that the petitioner has been in solitary confinement for more than one and a half years and it is in gross violation of law laid 19 down by the Supreme Court in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration and Others (1978) 4 SCC 494 and Shatrughan Chauhan.Observing that the custodial segregation specified in Section 30(2) of the Prisons Act is attracted, only after the mercy petition is rejected by the President or the Governor and only then the person is â€œunder sentence of deathâ€ attracting custodial segregation specified in Section 30(2) of the Prisons Act, in Shatrughan Chauhan, it was held as under:â€œ90.It was, therefore, held in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration (1978) 4 SCC 494 that the solitary confinement, even if mollified and modified marginally, is not sanctioned by Section 30 of the Prisons Act for prisoners â€œunder sentence of deathâ€.Even if this Court has awarded capital sentence, it was held that Section 30 does not cover him so long as his petition for mercy to the Governor and/or to the President permitted by the Constitution, has not been disposed of.During that interregnum, he attracts the custodial segregation specified in Section 30(2), subject to the ameliorative meaning assigned to the provision.
