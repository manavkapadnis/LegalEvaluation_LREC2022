3636 OF 2016 UNION OF INDIA & ORS.Appellant(s) VERSUS GOPALDAS BHAGWAN DAS & ORS.In a proceeding that was filed, insofar as other lands in Village Malad were concerned, covered by the same section 4 notification, this Court in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala v. State of Maharashtra and Ors.Section 4 requirement of the that Act, the this Court notification After setting out observed under that Section 4 the be published in the Official Gazettee and the requirement that the Acquiring Authority should publish public notices of the substances of such notification in a convenient place or 2 CIVIL APPEAL NO.This Court in J&K; Housing Board v. Kunwar Sanjay Krishan Kaul has observed that all the formalities of serving notice to the interested person, stipulated under Section 4 of the Act, has to be mandatorily complied with in the manner provided therein, even though the interested persons have knowledge of the acquisition proceedings.This Court further observed thus: â€œ32.It is settled law that when any statutory provision provides a particular manner for doing a particular act, the said thing or act must be done in accordance with the manner prescribed therefor in the Act.2.The High Court upheld the plea of the respondents relying upon judgment of this Court in â€œKulsum R. Nadiadwala Vs. State of Maharashtraâ€ (2012) 6 SCC 348\.& Ors.As learned against senior these submissions, counsel appearing Shri on Shyam behalf Divan, of the respondents, argued that that the section 4 notification in both these cases being the same, and Kulsum R. Nadiadwalaâ€™s case being a final judgment of this Court in which a review petition and a curative petition have been dismissed, the said judgment would apply on all fours to the facts of this case.He pointed out that the question of delay, though raised by the learned counsel who appeared on behalf of the State, was not directly answered in Kulsum R. Nadiadwalaâ€™s case inasmuch as, according to the Division Bench of this Court in Kulsum R. Nadiadwalaâ€™s case, a mandatory condition of a section 4 notification not being adhered to, would amount to there being no acquisition at all in the eye of law.Given the fact that this is a Defence project in which possession has been with the Union since 1942, the same facts would obtain as in Kulsum R. Nadiadwalaâ€™s case in which relief has been granted to Kulsum R. Nadiadwala.This case, therefore, cannot lead to a different conclusion on similar facts.On a reading of paragraph 16 of Kulsum R. Nadiadwalaâ€™s judgment, it is important to note that though the appellantâ€™s claim was restricted to only 50 per cent of the land in question, so far as the other 50 per cent is concerned, the judgment itself makes a reference to the fact that the appellants are legal heirs of one deceased Ismail Nadiadwala and that there was another claimant whose name was Ibrahim Nadiadwala to whom, presumably, 50 per cent of the property went.
