and acting in a cruel and The explanation to Exception 4 to Section 300 undoubtedly provides that it is immaterial in such a case which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.His version that he was heavily drunk and it was his wife who fully supported him and he was finding it difficult to walk under the influence of alcohol.The question which arises in this case is: Even if the defence version is not held to be fully established by a balance of probabilities, were there not sufficient pointers in evidence of what was probably the truth which leaked out from some statements of the prosecution witnesses themselves?It was held in the case of Rishi Kesh Singh by a majority of a Full Bench of nine Judges of the Allahabad High Court explaining and relying upon the decisions of this Court discussed there (at p. 51): â€œThe accused person who pleads an exception is entitled to be acquitted if upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole (including the evidence given in support of the plea of the general exception) a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court about the guilt of the accused.â€ 13 In that case, the result of a consideration of the decision of this Court in relation to the provisions of Section 105 of the Evidence Act was summed up by me as follows (at pages 97-98): â€œ... an accused's plea of an exception may reach one of three not sharply demarcated stages, one succeeding the other, depending upon the effect of the whole evidence in the case judged by the standard of a prudent man weighing or balancing probabilities carefully.Provisions of Section 105 of the Evidence Act, which are applicable in such cases, contain what are really two kinds of burden of the accused who sets up an exception: â€œfirstly, there is the onus laid down of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Penal Code, 1860, or, within any special exception or proviso contained in 14 any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence,â€ and, secondly, there is the burden of introducing or showing evidence which results from the last part of the provision which says that â€œthe Court shall presume the absence of such circumstancesâ€.The effect of this obligatory presumption at the end of Section 105 of the Evidence Act is that the Court must start by assuming that no facts exist which could be taken into consideration for considering the plea of self- defence as an exception to the criminal liability which would otherwise be there.The last mentioned burden is not really a burden of establishing the plea fully but of either introducing or of showing the existence of some evidence to justify the taking up of the plea.(as he then was) in a case where an accused pleaded the exception under Section 84 IPC (Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar v. State of Gujarat [AIR 1964 SC 1563 : (1964) 2 Cri LJ 472]): â€œThe prosecution, therefore, in a case of homicide shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused death with the requisite intention described in Section 299 of the Penal Code, 1860.Keeping the above legal position in mind, we scrutinised the evidence to ascertain whether the deceased could have been the aggressor.v. Lakhmi; 1998(4) SCC 336 the case involved death of the respondentâ€™s wife.The need of law for examining the accused with reference to incriminating circumstances appearing against him in prosecution evidence is not for observance of a ritual in a trial, nor is it a mere formality.If that suggestion deserves consideration we have to turn to the question whether the benefit of Exception I to Section 300 of the IPC should be extended to him?It is axiomatic that burden on the accused to prove any fact can be discharged either through defence evidence or even through prosecution evidence by showing a preponderance of probability.There can be no quarrel with the principles which have been laid down.Principles of law however cannot be appreciated or applied irrespective of the facts obtaining in a particular case.Ultimately, the question would fall to be decided, no doubt, on the basis of appreciation of evidence and the requirements of law flowing from the particular 23 provision of law.Section 86 of the IPC enunciates presumption that despite intoxication which is not covered by the last limb of the provision, the accused person cannot ward off the consequences of his act.Section 86 begins by referring to an act which is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent.Section 86 does not attribute intention as such to an intoxicated man committing an act which amounts to an offence when the act is done by a person harbouring a particular intention.This question has engaged the attention of this Court in the decision in Basdev v. State of Pepsu AIR 1956 SC 488.This Court inter alia held as follows: â€œ4.This is not the first time that the question comes up for consideration.But if he had not gone so deep in drinking, and from the facts it could be found that he knew what he was about, we can apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act or acts.Motive is something which prompts a man to form an intention and knowledge is an awareness of the consequences of the act.Section 300 of the IPC declares 32 that except in those cases which are specifically excepted culpable homicide is murder in situations which have been specifically laid down.What was the need for the Legislature to â€˜waste wordsâ€™ as it were by declaring that culpable homicide is murder if the act fell within any of the 4 clauses in Section 300 of the IPC?In order that an act is to be punished as must murder, it be declared to be murder.cases of culpable This Court in the judgment in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Rayavarapu Punnayya and Another 1976(4) SCC 382 inter alia held as follows: 33 21\.From the above conspectus, it emerges that whenever a court is confronted with the question whether the offence is â€˜murderâ€™ or â€˜culpable homicide not amounting to murderâ€™, on the facts of a case, it will be convenient for it to approach the problem in three stages.The question to be considered at the first stage would be, whether the accused has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of another.Proof of such causal connection between the act of the accused and the death, leads to the second stage for considering whether that act of the accused amounts to â€œculpable homicideâ€ as defined in Section 299.Going by the circumstances present in this case and in particular injuries suffered, it is quite clear that the act would fall within the scope of Section 300 of the IPC.If the act results in culpable homicide which does not amount to murder, then and then alone the question arises of applying Section 304 Part-I or PartII as the case may be.Appellant cannot extricate himself from the consequence of his act attracting the ingredients of murder by pointing out Section 304 Part I which also contains the expression, â€œthe act with the intention to cause deathâ€™.The implications are vastly Section 304 of the IPC would apply only in a case where culpable homicide is not murder.If the act amounting to culpable homicide satisfies any of the four criteria to bring it under the offence of murder, being mutually exclusive, there can be no scope for 35 applying Section 304 of the IPC.If the act which caused the death and which is culpable homicide is done with the intention of causing death, then it would be murder.This is however subject to the act not being committed in circumstances attracting any of the 5 exceptions.The act amounts to murder within the meaning of Section 300 of the IPC.
