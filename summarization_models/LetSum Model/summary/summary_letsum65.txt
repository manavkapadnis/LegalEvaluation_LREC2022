He sought support of Section 27 of the Act which protected acts done in good faith under the Act.The principles relating to discharge under Sections 227 and 228 were discussed, and finally, it was held as follows: “41.In view of the above said citations, it is evident that act of A-3 in directing his subordinates to issue MOP to M/s.Consciously he passed the order in violation of the statutory provisions.v. It is open to the accused to explain away the materials giving rise to the grave suspicion.The defence of the accused is not to be looked into at the stage when the accused seeks to be discharged under Section 227 of the Cr.PC (See State of J & K v. Sudershan Chakkar and another3).It reads as follows: “To: The Director 4 AIR 2005 SC 359 19 Mines & Geology Mineral Khanija Bhavan Race Course Road Bangalore.The said act will attract provisions of Rule 37 of the Rules.One of the questions which fell for decision was the effect of there being no previous sanction of the Government under Rule 37 for the transfer of lease.It is in 25 the nature of an enabling provision which authorises a transfer by the lessee to a person who has a certificate of approval, and, directs that such transfer could be made with the previous sanction of the Government subject to the other conditions with which we are not concerned.There is a distinction between a statutory provision which contains an express prohibition against the performance of a certain act and one which enables its performance subject to prescribed conditions.While in the former case, there will be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion if nothing else could be said about it that the absolute prohibition against the performance of the act is what is forbidden by law, the same could not be said if the matter falls within the second category.
