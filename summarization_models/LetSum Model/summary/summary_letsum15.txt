Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side) Md.Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 distance, the said unknown person took out one nepala from a polythene bag kept inside a shawl and held out threat on the complaint by pressing the said Nepala in his abdomen and asked him to give the money whatever he had with him.Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 ria nor specific overt act was found on the part of the appellant.It is well settled principle of law that the place of occurrence of the alleged offence should not be doubtful otherwise it damages trustworthiness of the version of the eye witnesses in its totality when the evidence of the alleged eye witnesses raise serious doubt in respect of their presence at the time of actual occurrence.1,000/- & Rs.Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 Sukumar Sharma P.W.3 has also testified the fact of incident to this effect that when he was coming from Dum Dum towards 50 feet Chiriamore he saw gathering there and the police who recovered a 'napala' from the nearby bush on 50 feet road known as 7 Tanks Lane.Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 also identified as the driver of the said three wheeler.The technicalities of law also do not necessarily upset the finding of facts and the order of conviction.Therefore, I do not find any ground to interfere into the findings of fact holding the appellant guilty of the offences as alleged, however, I have heard Mr. Bhattacharyya who argued with force of law that sentences under Sections 392 and 397 of the IPC cannot go together.In support of his contention reference to a decision in case of Swapan Kumar Khan vs. State of West Bengal reported in 2014(2) AICLR 516 has been made adverting my attention to the observation in paragraphs 42, 43, 44 and 45 which are reproduced hereunder for peaceful consideration-"42.Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 of the opinion that Section 394 was the right section to implicate the miscreants who committed the offence.It is a settled principle of law that one person who commits robbery or theft or dacoity cannot be also the receiver of stolen property or receiver of booty of dacoity and as such the person who has been convicted either u/s 394 or u/s 397 or u/s 379 of the Code cannot be convicted in respect of the charge whether it is alternative or not for the offence punishable either u/s 411 or u/s 412 of the Indian Penal Code.Thus, the conviction clamped u/s 412 had no sanction of law on the facts and circumstances of this case."Having taken into consideration the proposition laid and in particular adhering to the provisions of Section 397 IPC in conjoint reading with Section 392 IPC, I find that under Section 397 IPC for commission of robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt, if, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years.It is settled principle of law that to attract Section 397 IPC the offence of dacoity or robbery has been committed.Salim @ Shamim vs The State Of West Bengal on 23 May, 2019 Accordingly, the sentence under Section 397 IPC stands modified.
