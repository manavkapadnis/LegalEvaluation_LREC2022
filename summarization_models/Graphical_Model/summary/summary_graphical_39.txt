Per contra, the orders impugned are duly supported on behalf of the respondent with reference to the findings recorded against the appellant by the Trial Court.Lastly, it is also the contention of the appellant that the accused No.

Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record, we are inclined to allow these appeals and while setting aside the orders impugned, restore the applications seeking suspension of execution of sentence under Section 389 CrPC for consideration afresh by the High Court.We feel it imperative to restore the applications for consideration afresh for the fundamental reason that the approach of the High Court in dealing with the applications made on behalf of the appellant under Section 389 CrPC had apparently been from a wrong angle and on two major misconceptions: One, that the High Court assumed as if the sentences awarded to the appellant for different offences are to run consecutively i.e., one after another and, while taking sum total of the sentences so awarded, the High Court has proceeded as if the accused appellant has been ordered to undergo imprisonment for a whopping 45 years.
Considering the said alleged voluntary act of the accused and various other circumstances, the trial Court appears to have arrived at a conclusion holding that the accused is guilty of the alleged offences.However, after due trial in Special Case No.
In view of the said fact that the accused has been found guilty of the offences, more particularly, of those punishable under Sections 420, 409, 468, 471 and 477A of IPC and also under Section 13(2) r/w Section 13(1)(c) and (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, I do not find that non-examination of the hand writing expert would be a convincing ground for seeking suspension of sentence of the appellant.The learned counsel has further argued that the reference to the decision in Navjot Singh Sidhu (supra), was also misplaced because the appellant herein had only prayed for suspension of sentence and not for suspension of his conviction.
This Court pointed out the subtle distinction in the proposition for suspension of an order of conviction on one hand and that for suspension of sentence on the other.Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Navjot Singh Sidhu vs State of Punjab & Another reported in (2007) 2 SCC 574 with respect to Section 389 (1) of Cr.P.C and suspension of the order appealed against, was pleased to observe that, the Appellate Court can suspend the order of conviction only when the convict specifically shows the consequences that may follow, if the order is not suspended or stayed.
The said appeal has been admitted for hearing by the High Court.1 of 2018 and 1 of 2019 in Criminal Appeal No.
He was sentenced accordingly by the Special Court.Secondly, the High Court has proceeded to refer to the principles governing the consideration of the prayer for suspension of the operation of the order of conviction, although the prayer in the present matter had only been for suspension of execution of sentence.
