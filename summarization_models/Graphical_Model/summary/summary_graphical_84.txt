The appellant managed to free himself and shot Uma Shanker who fell down as a consequence of a fire arm injury.2 This appeal arises from a judgment and order of a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 5 September 2017.

7 Having regard to the circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the conviction under Section 302 of the IPC should be converted to one under Section 304 Part I.We accordingly hold the appellant guilty of 4 an offence under Section 304 Part I of the IPC and sentence him to imprisonment for a term of ten years.
The High Court held that the presence of PW 1 was natural, having regard to the time and place of the incident.
When he reached the Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by SANJAY KUMAR Date: 2020.02.12 17:33:10 IST Reason: disputed plot while passing through the Chak road, he noticed that Durga Prasad, the brother of the appellant, was getting a mound dug with the 1 IPC 2 help of two labourers, one of whom was Ram Nath (PW 2).4 The eye-witness account of the occurrence was based on the depositions of the complainant Gaya Prasad (PW 1) and Ram Nath (PW 2).
Moreover, PW 1 did not implicate Durga Prasad in the crime despite his presence which was an indicator of the fact that he had given a truthful account of the actual incident.Taking cognizance of the fact that PW 1 is a father of the deceased, the High Court, on a careful evaluation of his testimony, found no reason to discredit his account.
