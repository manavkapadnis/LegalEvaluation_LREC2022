Pursuant to a Criminal Proceedings lodged by the Officer-in-Charge, Anti-Corruption Bureau being PS case no.148/ACB PS 04/2015 dated 20th August, 2015, the petitioner was in custody for a period exceeding 48 hours and came to be suspended from service by order dated 25th August, 2015.The petitioner's position as a Sub-Assistant Engineer with the Howrah Municipal Corporation is the reason for which the petitioner may have been offered bribe in the first place.

The Articles of charge appear to be substantially similar to those against the petitioner in the criminal proceedings pending under Section 7 of the PC Act.He, therefore, submits that the Howrah Municipal Corporation could not have initiated any departmental proceedings in respect of his service.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the clear view that the judgment in the case of Amit Biswas (supra) has no manner of application in the instance case.(RAJASEKHAR MANTHA, J.)
