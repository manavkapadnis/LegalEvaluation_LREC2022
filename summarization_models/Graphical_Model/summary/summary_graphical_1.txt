Daga, Advocate for the Appellant.PW-4 Rafiq has simply stated about assault by the appellant on the deceased.

Police converted the offence to Section 302 of IPC.He was charge-sheeted for the offence under Section 302 of IPC.
There is every reason to uphold the opinion of the trial Court about homicidal death.The learned trial Judge has discussed about proof of all the circumstances.
EVIDENCE 06] On going through the evidence of seven eye-witnesses, we find that only PW-4 Rafiq Sheikh, PW-7 Anushka (daughter) and PW-6 Rajesh Randke have supported the assault by the appellant on the deceased.Merely because postmortem is admitted (Exh.63) by defence, it does not relieve the prosecution to prove the ingredients of Section 300 of IPC.
Report does not suggest of finding out blood of deceased on that knife.CASELAWS 13] The appellant relied upon the judgment in the case of Sunder Lal vs. State of Rajasthan reported in (2007) 10 SCC 371 and the case of Tularam vs.
... on 11 January, 2019 convert the conviction from Section 302 to Section 304 of IPC.... on 11 January, 2019 murder.
In the case of direct evidence, the motive as a circumstance is not so important as in the case of circumstantial evidence.If, however, such evidence is adduced, then the duty of the Court is to assess the evidence.
