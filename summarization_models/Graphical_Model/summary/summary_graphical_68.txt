The senior counsel on behalf of the appellant submitted that the PC Act is a comprehensive statute which was passed to prevent corruption and therefore, should be construed liberally as the legislature intended to include the abovementioned acts, which harm the public at large, within the ambit of the PC Act.And from time immemorial, as at the present day, this privilege of being a corporation or artificial body of individuals, with power of holding their property, rights, and immunities in common as a legally organized body and of transmitting the same in such body by an artificial succession different from the natural succession of the property of individuals has been considered a franchise which could not be lawfully assumed by any associated body without a special authority for that purpose from the government or sovereign power."

Prima facie, a grave suspicion is made out that the respondent was rendering his service by dealing with the students and the examination aspect of the University.Therefore, in line with the aforesaid proposition, this case is not an appropriate one to have exercised the power under Section 227 to discharge the accusedÂ­respondent herein, having regards to the facts and circumstances of the case.

Under the UGC Act, University is defined and recognized under Section 2(f) in the following manner: â€œUniversityâ€ means a University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act, and includes any such institution as may, in consultation with the University concerned, be recoginsed by the Commission in accordance with the regulations made in this behalf under this Act.(2)(c).
The above principle of law was recently applied by a 3Â­Judge Bench of this Court in Bangalore Turf Club Ltd. v. Regional Director, ESI Corporation, (2014) 9 SCC 657, where an argument was advanced by counsel that the interpretation of the term â€˜shopâ€™ under the ESI Act should be determined in light of the definition of the same under the relevant Shops and Commercial Establishments Act.Recently, this Court in the case of CBI v. Ramesh Gelli, (2016) 3 SCC 788, dealt with the question as to whether Chairman, Directors and officers of a private bank before its amalgamation with a public sector bank, can be classified as public servants for prosecution under the PC Act.
Before the PC Act, 1988, it was the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Sections 161 to 165Â­A in Chapter IX IPC which were governing the field of law relating to prevention of corruption.It cannot be lost sight of that the Act, 1988, as its predecessor that is the repealed Act of 1947 on the same subject, was brought into force with avowed purpose of effective prevention of bribery and corruption.
Therefore, the duty of the Court is that any antiÂ­corruption law has to be interpreted and worked out in such a fashion as to strengthen the fight against corruption.
