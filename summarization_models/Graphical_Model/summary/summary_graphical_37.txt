Vide memo dated 2nd August, 2007 the Deputy Chief Personal Officer on behalf of the General Manager, South Eastern Railway intimated the Secretary, Railway Board that no vigilance and special police enquiry case was pending against the petitioner.Advocate submits that the Railway Board vide its communication dated 18/21 September, 2007 had accepted the resignation of the petitioner with effect from 23rd October, 2007 only after getting clearance that no vigilance enquiry case was pending against the petitioner.

In the instant case the department never initiated any proceeding against the petitioner either during or after his resignation from service.In cases in which a railway servant has committed an offence for which the penalty is dismissal or removal from service, no suggestion should be made to him to tender his resignation.
In the case of Soumen Das (supra) a learned Single Judge of this Court held that the investigation conducted by the CBI is to be guided by the executive instructions issued by the Central Government from time to time which is the CBI manual.
It is not within the jurisdiction of the writ Court to act as an Investigating Officer and decide the correctness and the allegations made in the FIR.1) chapter 3 deals with termination of service.
The primary contention of the respondents is that specific Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68190032/ 5 Ramesh Saran Rai vs Union Of India & Ors on 25 January, 2019 information was received from a source alleging corruption against the petitioner, his wife and brother-in-law and only after due verification of the said source information the CBI registered the FIR against the petitioner.The Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68190032/ 11 Ramesh Saran Rai vs Union Of India & Ors on 25 January, 2019 petitioner is directed to cooperate with the CBI in the course of enquiry.
The primary contention of the petitioner is that the contents of the FIR is ex facie incorrect and untrue in view of the categorical intimation given by the General Manager, South Eastern Railway, Kolkata to the Secretary of the Railway Board on 2nd August, 2007 intimating that there was no vigilance and special police enquiry case pending against the petitioner.He points out that in the present case the petitioner is enjoying an order of stay since 25th January, 2012.
In the instant case there is nothing on record to show that approval of the Competent Authority was taken prior to registration of a Regular Case against the petitioner.The allegations are extremely serious and the respondent authority ought to have conducted a thorough preliminary enquiry to verify the information received from its source and ascertain whether there was any misconduct on the part of the petitioner when he was in service.
