The learned senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the court must take into consideration the facts and circumstances brought on record and may draw inference to arrive at the conclusion whether demand and acceptance of the illegal gratification has been proved or not.It may also be proved by circumstantial evidence.

The learned senior counsel has drawn our attention to other cases to substantiate her contention that Satyanarayana had not taken note of the consistent view taken by the Supreme Court.Direct proof of demand may not be available in all the above instances but from the evidence of panch witness, acceptance of money was proved by Phenolphthalein Test and by raising presumption under Section 20 of the Act, it is permissible to draw inference to prove the demand.
In the said case, the complainant died before the trial and thus could not be examined by the prosecution.Since the complainant passed away before the trial, he could not be examined.
We are of the opinion that the following issue requires consideration by the larger Bench:The question whether in the absence of evidence of complainant/direct or primary evidence of demand of illegal gratification, is it not permissible to draw inferential deduction of culpability/guilt of a public servant under Section 7 and Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 based on other evidence adduced by the prosecution.Act).
Direct evidence is one of the modes through which a fact can be proved.Presumption is an inference of a certain fact drawn from other proved facts.
This appeal arises out of the judgment dated 02.04.2009 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Criminal Appeal Nos.15 and 4 of 2007 in and by which the High Court affirmed the conviction of the appellant under Section 7 and Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon her.Affirming the conviction of the appellant/accused, this Court held that ..the tell-tale circumstances which do indicate that there must have been a demandand it is not proper to say that there is no evidence of demand of bribe as on November 20, 1974.
The presumption is of course rebuttable but in the present case there is no material to rebut the presumption.PW-5-shadow witness was examined who supported the case of the prosecution.
