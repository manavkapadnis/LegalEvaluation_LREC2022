So far as Kamal’s conviction is concerned, we find from the Trial Court judgment that there was recovery of his wearing apparels with bloodstains on the basis of his statement.On the basis of evidence disclosed, the Trial Court and the High Court found that there was prior meeting of minds of all the four convicts and all the three appellants had intention common with that of Kamal.

The learned counsel for the appellants highlighted two sets of discrepancies from the depositions of the prosecution witnesses.On that basis a case under Section 302/34 was started.
These injuries have been recorded in the judgments of the Trial Court and the High Court.We find the approach of the Trial Court and the High Court in appeal was proper in dealing with the discrepancies pointed out on behalf of the appellants.
