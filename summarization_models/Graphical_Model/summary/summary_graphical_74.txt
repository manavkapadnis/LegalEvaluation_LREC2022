It is submitted that at the time when the High Court condoned the delay, the same was not conditional, namely, to deny the statutory benefits and the interest for the interregnum period – delayed period.It is submitted that the order condoning the delay had attained finality and therefore subsequently it is not open for the appellant to submit that the High Court ought not to have awarded the statutory benefits and the interest for the delayed period.

However, considering the fact that in other matters the delay was condoned, the High Court condoned the delay and entertained the appeals and enhanced the amount of compensation at par with other land owners/claimants whose lands were acquired for the same project vide the same notification.We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.

Similar view is expressed by this Court in the case of K. Subbarayudu (supra) and while condoning the delay in preferring the appeal, this Court has denied the interest for the period of delay.In the case of Dhiraj Singh (supra), while condoning the delay in preferring the appeal before this Court, while enhancing the amount of compensation at par with other similarly situated land owners, this Court has denied the interest on the enhanced amount of compensation for the period of delay in approaching the High Court by way of LPAs.

It is not in dispute that there was a huge delay of five and a half years in preferring the appeals before the High Court challenging the judgment and award passed by the Reference Court.Therefore, as such, no fault can be found with the order passed by the High Court condoning the delay.
