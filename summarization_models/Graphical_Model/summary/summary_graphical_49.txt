Four questions arise for consideration in this appeal−first, whether the High Court was justified in convicting the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC when, in fact, the initial Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/ 5 Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019 trial was on the basis of a charge under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC ?In other words, it is only when any omission to frame the charge initially or till culmination of the proceedings or at the appellate stage results in failure of justice or causes prejudice, the same may result in vitiating the trial in appropriate case.

In other words, the High Court upheld the conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC in place of 302/149 IPC.Even the High Court while altering the charge from Section 149 IPC to Section 34 IPC did not refer to any evidence nor gave any reasons as to on what basis these three appellants could still be proceeded with under Section 34 IPC notwithstanding the acquittal of remaining eight co−accused.

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.The three accused persons, namely, Mala Singh(A−7), Phuman Singh(A−8) and Kashmiro(A−9), who suffered the conviction/sentence felt aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the High Court and they filed the present appeal by way of special leave in this Court.
Before parting, we place on record a word of appreciation for the valuable services rendered by Mr. Karan Bharihoke amicus curiae appointed by this Court.In Lachman Singh v. The State, AIR 1952 SC 167, it was held that when there is a charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 149 and the charge under section 149 disappears because of the acquittal of some of the accused, a conviction under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 34is good even though there is no separate charge under section 302 read with section 34, provided the accused could have been so charged on the facts of the case.
This appeal is filed by the three accused persons against the final judgment and order dated 11.02.2008 passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Appeal No.65−DB of 1999 whereby the Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal in respect of eight accused persons and Signature Not Verified acquitted them from the charges under Sections 148, Digitally signed by ANITA MALHOTRA Date: 2019.02.12 17:09:30 IST Reason: 302/149, 323/149 and 506/149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as IPC) but dismissed the appeal in respect of the three accused persons (appellants herein) and convicted them under Section 302/34 IPC instead of Section 302/149 IPC.
(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.would reveal that an alteration of charge where no prejudice is caused to the accused or the prosecution is well within the powers and the jurisdiction of the Court including the Appellate Court.
