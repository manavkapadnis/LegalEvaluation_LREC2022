Nashik )...Respondent \----Ms. Shradha Sawant for Appellant in Appeal No.The Appellant herein was working as a clerk in the office of District Sub- Auditor and in the year 2006, he holding charge as Auditor and Senior Clerk at the office of Co-operative Society at Malegaon.

The thrust of the argument of the learned counsel for the 9 6 Apeal 497 of 2014 Appellant is that the present Appellant had not demanded the amount.Accused No.1 had informed the complainant that he has to deposit audit fees and accordingly, asked him to accept the amount and he had accepted the amount.

It is only on proof of acceptance of illegal gratification that presumption can be drawn under Section 20 of the Act that such gratification was received for doing or forbearing to do any official act.The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of C. Sukumaran Vs. State of Kerala [(2015) 11 Supreme Court Cases 314] has observed as follows: "It has been continuously held by this Court in a catena of cases after interpretation of the previsions of Section 7 and 13(1) (d) of the Act that the demand of illegal gratification by the accused is the sine qua non for constituting an offence under the provisions of the act.
If the story set up by the prosecution inherently militates against or is inconsistent with the fact presumed, the presumption will be rendered sterile from its very inception, if out of judicial courtesy it cannot be rejected out of hand as still- born."131], wherein the Court has observed as follows: "In the result, the test to be applied is, whether the facts, primary to proof of facts of acceptance and payment of bribe was initially proved enough to the extent and level of the raising presumption, and if so, what is the weight of the defence raised by the accused was adequate enough to create preponderance of proof of his defence being factual and probable."
Such of the facts necessary for the decision of this appeal are as under.497 OF 2014 Ramdas Waman Tadge ) Age 41 years, Occupation Service, ) Jr.
