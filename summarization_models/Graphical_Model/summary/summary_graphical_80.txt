We may also note that we find that in various publications, there is a comma between the words â€˜shamilatâ€™ and â€˜tarafâ€™.In India, land is said to be the true basis for the unity in a village, supplying the ultimate bond between the residents of the village who collectively are known as the village community.

The purpose of the section which defines â€˜shamilat dehâ€™ is that the land described as â€˜shamilatâ€™, â€˜tarafâ€™, â€˜pattiâ€™, â€˜pannaâ€™ and â€˜tholaâ€™ not used for the benefit of the village community will not 9 be treated as â€˜shamilat dehâ€™.Keeping in view, what we have held above, it appears to us that the absence of a comma is a mistake and in fact according to us, a comma should be read after â€˜shamilatâ€™ and before â€˜tarafâ€™ in the latter part of the section also.
Patti is described as division of land into separate portions or strips in a village.Patti is basically, therefore, a small division of the village.
The contention of the appellant(s) is that the land in dispute though â€˜shamilatâ€™ land, is actually a patti in possession of the appellant(s) and his ancestors for more than a century and is not being used for the common purposes of the village and, therefore, does not fall within the definition of â€˜shamilat dehâ€™ land.He then filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, which was rejected with the following reasoning: â€œWhile examining the first contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner, as has been noticed in the forgoing paragraph, it is necessary to refer to clause (3) of Section 2(g) of the Act extracted hereinabove, which expressly treats â€œshamlatâ€, â€œtarafsâ€, â€œpattisâ€, â€œpannasâ€ and â€œtholasâ€ as separate and distinct, while describing the nature of the land.
The earlier entries in the column of ownership which read as â€˜Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubiâ€™ were replaced by the entry â€˜Panchayat Dehâ€™.From the revenue records produced, we find that the land has been shown as â€˜Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubiâ€™.
Rattiganâ€™s â€˜A Digest on Civil Law for the 2 Punjabâ€™, which is the one of the finest treaties on customary law of Punjab, are relevant: â€œâ€¦.Lands so reserved are jealously guarded as the common property of the original body of settlers who founded the village or of their descendants, and occasionally also those who assisted the settlers in clearing the waste and bringing it under cultivation are recognized as having a share in these reserved plots.
In case the word shamilat is missing from any of these four terms, then the land cannot be said to be belonging to a group of people and could never become â€˜shamilat dehâ€™ land.Accordingly, we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 03.07.2008 and the orders of all the authorities below.
