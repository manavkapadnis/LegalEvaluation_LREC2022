The appellant purported to take this action as the first respondent had been appointed an interim CEO and the person appointed did not fulfill the eligibility criteria prescribed by the Reserve Bank of 1 â€œCEOâ€ â€œ1960 Actâ€ 3 â€œPC Actâ€ 4 â€œBoDâ€ 2 2 India5.Enactment A may in itself be clear and unambiguous.

The decision of the High Court will have serious ramifications in terms of divesting the regulatory control over the affairs of Central Societies.
The view of the Division Bench will have far-reaching repercussions in the cooperative set up and the beneficial purpose of the legislation would be defeated resulting in mismanagement and misappropriation of public funds.In the view of the Division Bench, the power to appoint a CEO could only be exercised by the Registrar upon the failure of the District Central Cooperative Bank to make an appointment within a specified time period.
Section 54(1) provides that the â€œno society shall appoint a Manager, Secretary, Accountant and other paid officer unless he holds such qualifications as may be prescribedâ€.Where two interpretations of potentially conflicting provisions are possible, courts must adopt the interpretation that furthers the intention of the legislature as encapsulated in the maxim Verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam pereat.
Before we deal with the fact situation in the present appeal, we reiterate the settled legal position in law, that is, if in a Statutory Rule or Statutory Notification, there are two expressions used, one in General Terms and the other in special words, under the rules of interpretation, it has to be understood that the special words were not meant to be included in the general expression.
The principle that the general provision excludes the more specific has been consistently applied by this Court in South Indian Corporation (P) Ltd. v Secretary, Board of Revenue12, Paradip Port Trust v Their Workmen13, 12 13 AIR 1964 SC 207 AIR 1977 SC 36 25 Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Education v Paritosh Bhupesh Kumar Sheth14, CCE v Jayant Oil Mills,15 P S Sathappan v Andhra Bank Ltd16, Sarabjit Rick Singh v Union of India17 and Pankajakshi v Chandrika18.The rule that general provisions should yield to specific provisions is not an arbitrary principle made by lawyers and Judges but springs from the common understanding of men and women that when the same person gives two 10 AIR 1961 SC 1170 23 directions one covering a large number of matters in general and another to only some of them his intention is that these latter directions should prevail as regards these while as regards all the rest the earlier direction should have effect.
Essentially, the case of the first respondent is that the appointment of its CEO lies solely within its discretion and neither the appellant as the apex society nor the Registrar has the power to appoint a CEO.
