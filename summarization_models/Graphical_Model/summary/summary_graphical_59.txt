In case of breach and violation of Section 4 and other provisions of the Act, the police officer cannot insist the Magistrate for taking cognizance under the Act on the basis of the record submitted by the police alleging contravention of the said Act.Consequently, the District Magistrate had ordered for immediate registration of the FIR under the aforesaid provisions .

Referring to the contents of the FIR, it is submitted that the appellant has been wrongly charge-sheeted by the police for the offences, as at the best there was violation of Section 4, which is punishable under Section 21 of the Mines Regulation Act.In this context, it was observed that Section 22 of the TOHO Act prohibits taking of cognizance except on a complaint made by an appropriate authority and therefore the police report filed by the CBI was only a complaint petition made by an appropriate authority in terms of Section 22 of the TOHO Act.

As noticed above, in the written submissions the appellant has relied upon Belsund Sugar Company Limited (supra), Sharat Babu Digumarti (supra) and Suresh Nanda (supra) to contend that where there is a special act dealing with a special subject, resort cannot be taken to a general act.We would also reject the contention raised by the appellant in the (2009) 109 DRJ 594 written submissions that the alleged theft of sand is not punishable under Section 379 read with Section 378 of the IPC as sand is an immovable property as per Section 3 (26) of the General Clauses Act.

Vimal Kumar Surana15 with reference to the provisions of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 and offences under Sections 419, 468, 471 and 472 of the IPC.Kanwar Pal Singh, the appellant, impugns the order dated 22 nd July 2019 whereby the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad has dismissed his petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Code for short) for quashing criminal prosecution under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC for short), Rules 3, 57 and 7 of the Uttar Pradesh Minor Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by RACHNA Date: 2019.12.18 16:10:30 IST Mineral (Concession) Rules, 1963, Sections 4 and 21 of the Mines Reason: and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (Mines Regulation Act for short), and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 arising out of Crime Case No.
