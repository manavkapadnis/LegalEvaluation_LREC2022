The learned Trial Judge found the appellant guilty of the charge punishable under Section 302 IPC.He has been handed down a punishment of imprisonment for life under Section 302 IPC.
(19) In view of the aforesaid, we are of the considered opinion that a case of murder has not been made out by the prosecution and to that extent we are not in agreement with the learned Trial Judge.We, however, uphold the sentence passed by the learned Trial Judge imposing fine of Rs.
(2) The victim was one Birendra Nath Ghosh @ Biltey.(7) The appellant has been convicted of having murdered Biltey.
However, the Explanation to the said Exception states that whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.
9 March, 1996 at about 4.45 P.M. he and Biltey were travelling towards Tribeni on Biltey's scooter.Heard On : 14.08.2019, 07.08.2019 CAV on : 14.08.2019 Judgment On : 03.09.2019 Arijit Banerjee, J.:(1) This is an appeal against the judgment and order dated 11 July, 2008 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Hooghly in ST No.
In the facts of the case we are not inclined to come to the conclusion that there was a premeditated plan on the part of the appellant to kill the victim.This is also another reason which persuades us to take the view that the prosecution has not been able to make out the case of their being intention on the part of the appellant to cause death of the victim which would attract conviction under Section 302 IPC.
