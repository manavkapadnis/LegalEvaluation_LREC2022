The appellant had kept the polythene bag with the currency notes in the right-side pant pocket of the appellant.The raiding party arrived at the spot and recovered the notes from the right-side pocket of the pant of the appellant.

The statutory presumption under Section 20 of the Act can be confuted by bringing on record some evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that the money was accepted other than for the motive or the reward under Section 7 of the Act.Thus, the presumption under Section 20 of the Act becomes applicable for the offence committed by the appellant under Section 7 of the Act.
We, therefore, find no good ground and reason to upset and set aside the findings recorded by the trial court that have been upheld by the High Court.On failure to surrender, coercive steps would (2011) 4 SCC 402 be taken by the trial court.
There is a contradiction in the testimony of Nand Lal (PW-2) and Hemant Kumar (PW-3) as to the place where the allegedly bribe money was asked and paid to the appellant.Nand Lal (PW-2) had suggested that he would give money in the presence of the other person, i.e., Hemant Kumar (PW-3), which suggestion was not accepted by the appellant.
The testimony of PW-6 is, however, highly doubtful and not trustworthy, for he had failed and avoided to answer the question from whom he had purchased the shed.This Court in Ashok Tshering Bhutia v. State of Sikkim5 referring to the earlier precedents has observed that a defect or irregularity in investigation however serious, would have no direct bearing on the competence or procedure relating to cognizance or trial.
... on 27 November, 2019 cross-examination was, however, clear and categoric that he had received the report of the Investigating Officer along with the kalandra of oral and documentary evidence.The adequacy of material placed before the sanctioning authority cannot be gone into by the court as it does not sit in appeal over the sanction order.
Therefore, what the law requires is the application of mind by the Sanctioning Authority on the material placed before it to satisfy itself of prima facie case that would constitute the offence.It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the valid sanction has been granted by the sanctioning authority after being satisfied that a case for sanction has been made out.
