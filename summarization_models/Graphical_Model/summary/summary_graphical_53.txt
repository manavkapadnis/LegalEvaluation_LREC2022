The purpose of conducting a preliminary inquiry has been elaborated in the following extract : Therefore, in view of various counter claims regarding registration or non-registration, what is necessary is only that the information given to the police must disclose the commission of a cognizable offence.At the stage of registration of FIR, what is to be seen is merely whether the information given ex facie discloses the commission of a cognizable offence.

Thereafter the ordinary law of the land must take its course and further inquiry be proceeded with in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure by lodging a first information report.7 The respondent instituted three successive petitions under Section 482 of CrPC before the High Court of Karnataka 3 for quashing of the criminal proceedings.
The law does not permit a mini trial at this stage.The events which transpired before 16 November 2012 before the FIR was registered and the collection of material would be inadmissible in evidence; (ii) while the decision of the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari allows a preliminary inquiry particularly in a case involving corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Trial Court erred in inferring from the decision of this Court that the investigating officer is entitled to collect evidence even before the FIR is lodged; (iii) there is nothing to indicate, even the existence of an entry in the Station Diary; (iv) in consequence, the decision of the trial court was inconsistent with the principle enunciated in Lalita Kumari, which warranted interference by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC; (v) as a matter of fact the trial against the second accused has proceeded and 4 (2014) 2 SCC 1 despite a lapse of seven years the prosecution has failed to produce a copy of the certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act; and (vi) in the absence of a certificate under Section 65B, there is an absence of material hence a discharge is warranted under Section 231 of the CrPC.
Emphasising this facet of sub-section (4) the decision in Anvar holds that the requirement of producing a certificate arises when the electronic record is sought to be used as evidence.It is alleged that though the complainant was not allowed to meet the respondent, he met his driver through whom he got to know that such cases were being mediated by the second accused, an advocate purporting to act as the agent of the respondent.
When the enquiry is to be held for the purpose of finding out whether criminal proceedings are to be resorted to the scope thereof must be limited to the examination of persons who have knowledge of the affairs of the delinquent officer and documents bearing on the same to -find out whether there is prima facie evidence of guilt of the officer.The parameters which govern the exercise of this jurisdiction have found expression in several decisions of this Court.
A complaint was lodged with the Lokayukta Police on 8 November 2012 apprehending that a bribe would be asked for by the second accused.21 In the present case, on 15 November 2016, the complainant is alleged to have met the respondent.
We accordingly maintain the order passed by the learned trial judge on 5 December 2016 dismissing the discharge application filed by the respondent.The High Court dismissed the third petition.
