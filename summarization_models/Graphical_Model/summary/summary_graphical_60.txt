has been filed with the prayer to quash the instant criminal prosecution of the applicant in Criminal Case No.And Anr on 22 July, 2019 Allahabad High Court Kanwar Pal Singh vs State Of U.P.

It has been argued by the learned counsel for the applicant that applicant has not carried out any illegal or unauthorized mining operation, rather he was granted two separate mining lease for 5 years and thus no cognizable offence is made out against the applicant.However, where the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and material on record even if taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused, the charge-sheet may be quashed in exercise of inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
The submissions raised by learned counsel for the applicant call for determination on questions of fact which may be adequately adjudicated upon only by the trial court and even the submissions made on points of law can also be more appropriately gone into only by the trial court.However, it was held that if the allegations do not constitute any offence as alleged and appear to be patently absurd and improbable, Court should not hesitate to quash the complaint.
403 of 2019 (State vs. Kanwar pal Singh), under Section 379 IPC, Rule 3/57/7 of U.P."In the facts and circumstances stated above, since the applicant has been charged with offence under Section 379 IPC besides the offences under Section 3/21 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957, under Rules 3/57/70 of the U.P.
