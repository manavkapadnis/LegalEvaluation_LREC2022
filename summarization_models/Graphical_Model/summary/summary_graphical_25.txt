Such In the opening paragraph of the order, the Court observed that the acquisition in this case had taken place without any notice or intimation to the writ petitioners.Though KMC maintains that due notice had been served and the land- owners had also been informed of the quantum of compensation that was payable to them, the writ petitioners in this case insist that neither was any previous notice issued to the petitioners nor was any offer made to receive compensation prior to the road being constructed on the writ petitioners' land.

However, the writ court granted the following liberty to the writ petitioners: "However, if the petitioners are dissatisfied with the amount of compensation, they are free to challenge such decision before the appropriate forum."This Court will try and assess the compensation payable as a reference would have under Section 18 of the Act of 1894.

The aforesaid inspection should be done within 8(eight) weeks from the date of the communication of this order.Accordingly, the relevant Land Acquisition Collector (I), Kolkata, is directed to conduct a survey with the help of such officials as may be necessary for the purpose.

BEFORE: The Hon'ble JUSTICE SANJIB BANERJEE And The Hon'ble JUSTICE KAUSIK CHANDA Date : 16th December, 2019.In such a scenario, particularly, when at the relevant time, there was the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 which guided as to how compensation would be decided, it is difficult to accept that the Act of 1980 in this State would provide for a different methodology for assessment or payment of lesser compensation than would be payable in respect of acquisition of land under the Act of 1894.
