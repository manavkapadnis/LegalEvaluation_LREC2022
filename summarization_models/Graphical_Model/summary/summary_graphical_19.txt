Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Applicant forcefully argued that(I) On the basis of First Information report, and statements recorded during investigation, no offence , even prima facie, is made out against the applicant.Therefore, the alleged theft is not from the possession of the Opp Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106900396/ 10 Avdhesh vs State Of Up And Another on 19 April, 2019 party no 2.

The section does not confer any new power on the High Court.Inherent jurisdiction under the section though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself.
It further held that Court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation/continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of Court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice.
(II) No recovery of the alleged stolen boring machine has been made out.(III) Applicant is brother-in-law (Jeeja) of the husband of the Opp Party no 2 and as there were some dispute amongst them and after death of husband of the Opp Party No 2, the applicant has been falsely implicated and nominated as accused in the present case.
By analysing the scope of Section 482 Cr.P.C., this Court laid down that authority of the Court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice the Court has power to prevent abuse.The judgment of this Court in State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal and others, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, has elaborately considered the scope and ambit of Section 482 Cr.P.C.
During investigation, the applicant and Dinesh had approached this Court by way of filing Criminal Misc Writ Petition No 27265 of 2018 for quashing of First Information report.To go over the facts briefly, Smt Neelam, Opp Party No 2 lodged a First Information Report registered at Case Crime No 346 of 2018 on 31.8.2018 at Police Station Talbehat, Distt Lalitpur, the contents of which were that she had opened a shop in the name and style "Kushwaha Bore Wales" at Laitpur for boring machine.
can be exercised to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or secure ends of justice.It would be an abuse of process of the court to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice.
