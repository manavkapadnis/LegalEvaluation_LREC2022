It is true that in the charge Exh.6 it is stated that alleged bribe was demanded to issue heirs certificate by the accused No.1, but when in the final and subsequently altered charge at Exh.70 it is specifically stated that alleged bribe was demanded for recording names of legal heirs of father of the complainant, on which charge the case proceeded, it cannot be said that the prosecution case is doubtful as argued by the learned Advocate for the accused.Therefore it cannot be said that the work of taking of entry of heirs of father of the complainant was not pending with the accused No.1 on the date of initial demand on 11.11.2006, on the basis of Exh.17 entry No.330 as argued by the learned Advocate for the accused.
Therefore this appeal by the appellants-accused on several grounds mentioned in the appeal.
In all these circumstances non seizure of shirt of the complainant is insignificant and the same is not sufficient to discard the evidence of the complainant, PW-2 and PI Ghuge and to say that the prosecution has not proved demand of bribe by accused No.1 and acceptance of bribe amount by both the accused.on 14.11.2006 and acceptance of said amount by both the accused.
It was held that it casts doubt about acceptance of illegal gratification and the prosecution case.It was held that conviction cannot be based on such evidence.
Thus, the contents of complaint (Exh.12) lodged by the complainant have corroborated the evidence of the ( 57 ) criappeal483.09 final complainant regarding initial demand of Rs.1,000/- made by accused No.1 on 11.11.2006 to the complainant.To prove the second demand made by the accused No.1 to the complainant prior to the trap on 14.11.2006 and acceptance of bribe amount by the accused and recovery of the said amount from the accused No.2, the prosecution has mainly relied upon the evidence of the complainant (PW-1) and PW-2 (panch No.1).
He told said fact to the officer of raiding party that accused No.1 is not available in the office of Belaswadi but he came to village Pimpri Nandu.On receiving this message PI Ghuge decided to proceed towards village Pimpri Nandu for carrying raid instead of going to village Belaswadi.
(l) In the case of V.Sejappa Vs. State By Police Inspector Lokayukta, Chitradurga, AIR 2016 Supreme Court, 2045, the appellant was acquitted by the trial Court for the offence punishable under Sections 7,13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act.Therefore there is no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and as such he claimed to dismiss the appeal.
Therefore, there is no proper sanction order to prosecute the accused.It is not the case of the prosecution that the accused No.2 demanded bribe amount to the complainant.
