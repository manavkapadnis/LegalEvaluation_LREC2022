The respondent preferred a criminal appeal6 before the High Court of Gujarat challenging his conviction.It is in pursuance of the above provision that a notice to show cause was issued to the respondent.

On the conviction of the employee for offences under Sections 279, 337, 338 and 304A of the Penal Code, his services were terminated.
Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the order of the learned Single Judge, as mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment, must be read together.14 The position in this regard was elaborated upon in a judgment of a two judge Bench decision of this Court in Dy Director of Collegiate Education (Admn) v S Nagoor Meera13, where Justice B P Jeevan Reddy speaking for the Court held: â€œ8.
The respondent was prosecuted for offences under Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120B read with Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Penal Code.In terms of Regulation 39(4)(i), â€œwhere a penalty is imposed on an employee on the grounds of conduct which had led to a conviction on a criminal chargeâ€, the appellant is independently entitled to take steps against the employee.
Considering the question of sentence within which the appeal is not likely to be heard, it is not in the interest of justice to ask the applicant to be in jail during the pendency of the appeal.On this set of facts, a two judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Justice Shivaraj V Patil, rejected the argument based on the principle of double jeopardy and held: 14 (2001) 6 SCC 584 15 (2003) 3 SCC 362 10 â€œ7â€¦ there was no question of the respondent suffering a double jeopardy.
Under the circumstances, the judgment dated 28.07.2014 passed by Special Judge, Ahmedabad, in Special Case No 27 of 1993 shall remain under suspension till final hearing and disposal of the appeal.The affidavit refers to the steps taken by the appellant thereafter to 9 (1995) 3 SCC 377 10 (2001) 6 SCC 584 11 (2003) 3 SCC 362 5 pursue the available remedies against the judgment of the High Court before this Court.
The appeal is pending before the High Court.Now, in this case, the respondent has been found guilty of corruption by a criminal court.
