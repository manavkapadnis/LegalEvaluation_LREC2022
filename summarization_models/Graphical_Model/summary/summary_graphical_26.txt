As opposed to this, Part VIII of Chapter XXXIII deals with acquisition and disposal of property by the Corporation.These are the only two modes contemplated under the Act for the purpose of acquisition by the Corporation.

Although Section 535 says that the Corporation shall have the power to acquire and hold immovable property or any interest therein but must it do so, in exercise of power under Section 352 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980 to give a lesser compensation?If we accept the argument of Mr. Ghosh on the scope and ambit of Section 363, there will be two sets of compensation one more onerous than the other but for the same purpose.

The cross objection against the order under appeal is that having returned a finding by the learned Single Judge that the mode and manner of acquisition dehors the provisions of the Act, the learned Single Judge, however, did not grant consequential relief of restoration of status quo ante, namely, restoration of the name of the writ petitioner in the assessment and municipal record of the Corporation.(3) For the purpose of acquisition of immovable property under this section, the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, shall be subject to the amendment that the market-value of any land or building to be acquired shall be deemed, for the purpose of sub-section (1) of section 23 of that Act, to be the market-value determined according to the disposition of such immovable property at the date of declaration under sub-section (1) of section 4 thereof in respect of such immovable property.
The compensation payable for land acquired under Section 352 attracts a lesser compensation than any Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107854050/ 7 Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... vs Bimal Kumar Shah on 17 December, 2019 land acquired under Section 537.We are of the opinion that Section 536 to 537 are of wide amplitude and cover all cases of acquisition of land or buildings under the Act, including those made for the purpose of opening a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107854050/ 9 Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... vs Bimal Kumar Shah on 17 December, 2019 park.
It is also significant to mention that in the year 2000 the Corporation has mutated the name of Birinchi Behari Shaw and realised all dues from him and till 2009 no due certificate was issued in his favour by the Assessment Department of the Corporation.Though it appears from the noting that the possession was taken way back in 1991 but the record maintained by the Corporation was not altered and / or corrected and in fact the Corporation continued to accept the property tax paid by the recorded owner in respect of the said property.
The Municipal Corporation was accordingly restrained by an order of perpetual injunction from giving any effect or further effect to the wrongful recording of its name as owner.
