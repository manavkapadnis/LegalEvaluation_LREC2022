Counsel for Applicant submits that as the work in office of Respondent No.2 was not being attended to and on 20.06.2006 bribe was demanded, after communicating to the staff there, that matter would be reported to Anti Corruption Bureau, applicant came out and also made a phone call to office of Anti Corruption Bureau.He has taken us through the relevant record to substantiate contention.

In this situation, taking overall view of the matter, we find that case either under Section 353 IPC or then under Section 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, is not made out against the Applicant.On next day, Respondent No.2 filed a false complaint against the Applicant implicating him in the offence under Section 353 and under Section 3(1)(x).
