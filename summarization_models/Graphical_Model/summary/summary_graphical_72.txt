The deceased was the wife of the appellant.PW2 to PW6, PW12 and PW14 are the brothers and sisters-in5 law of the appellant.

Dealing with the contention that offence would not be above 304 Part I, the Court noted that though the right of private defence was not set up under Section 313 Cr.PC., absence of such a plea would not stand in the way of the defence based on the exception being set up was the contention taken by the appellant.It must also be appreciated that under Section 106 of the Evidence Act facts within the exclusive knowledge of the appellant as to what transpired within the privacy of their bed room even must be established by the appellant.
The High Court by the impugned judgment has concurred with the view taken by the trial Court.The attempt at explaining the same has been correctly dispelled by the trial court.
Section 86 of the IPC enunciates presumption that despite intoxication which is not covered by the last limb of the provision, the accused person cannot ward off the consequences of his act.Motive is something which prompts a man to form an intention and knowledge is an awareness of the consequences of the act.
Principles of law however cannot be appreciated or applied irrespective of the facts obtaining in a particular case.The last mentioned burden is not really a burden of establishing the plea fully but of either introducing or of showing the existence of some evidence to justify the taking up of the plea.
He relied on the following judgments: (1) 1976(2) SCC 798 Par tap v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2) 1996 (6) SCC 457 Periasami and Another v. State of Tamil Nadu (3) 1998(4) SCC 336 State of U.P.The appeal stands dismissed.
In all such cases the court gets the advantage of knowing his version about those aspects and it helps the court to effectively appreciate and evaluate the evidence in the case.Applying the principles, let us examine the facts of this case.
