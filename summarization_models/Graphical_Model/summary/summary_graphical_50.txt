A civil suit is also stated to have been pending.The present two appeals have been preferred by the complainant and the State respectively.

The High Court in appeal concluded from the materials on record that the assault was made on the spur of the moment without premeditation and that both sides having suffered injuries the conviction ought to be altered under Section 304 Part I, IPC.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court erred in altering the conviction to one under Section 304 Part I, IPC.
The trial court convicted all the four accused.A fair criminal trial encompasses a fair investigation at the pre-trial stage, a fair trial where the prosecution does not conceal anything from the court and discharges its obligations in accordance with law impartially to facilitate a just and proper decision by the court in the larger interest of justice concluding with a fairness in sentencing also.
Their injury report has not been brought on record by the prosecution and no explanation has been furnished in that regard.Relying upon State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Faqirey , (2019) 5 SCC 605, it was submitted that the conviction ought to be restored to one under Section 302, IPC.
It, in fact, smacks of intentional mischief to misdirect the investigation as well as to withhold material evidence from the court.In Sunil Kundu v. State of Jharkhand , (2013) 4 SCC 422, this Court observed: 28When the prosecution is not able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt it cannot take advantage of the fact that the accused have not been able to probabilise their defence.
[NAVIN SINHA] NEW DELHI AUGUST 06, 2019.The relationship between parties and the existence of a land dispute regarding which a civil suit was also pending are undisputed facts.
Minor contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses were insufficient to doubt the prosecution case.In contradistinction to the same, the accused has only to create a doubt about the prosecution case and the probability of its defence.
