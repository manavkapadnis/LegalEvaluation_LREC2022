allegations of fraud and corruption
administration and management of the Oil-for-Food Programme
agents or contractors engaged in any illicit or corrupt activities
illicit income totalling about US$1.8 billion from companies
largest source of illicit income
payments were disguised by various subterfuges
AWB paid to Alia over $221.7 million
AWB made a large number of documents available to the IIC investigators
The evidence before this Court
AWB and Tigris entered into a transaction
evidence that AWB, or any of its employees, had made payments
after sales payments to individuals
No one in AWB knew of any money being channeled to the Iraqi regime
the discharge cost of US$12 pmt was added
AWB paid port fees at the rate of US$1,500 per vessel
such payments were "technically in breach of sanctions"
The Full Court rejected this approach
found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption
