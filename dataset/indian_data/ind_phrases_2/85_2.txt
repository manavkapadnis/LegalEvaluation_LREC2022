The petitioner is a death-row convict in Nirbhaya’s case which relates to the gangrape of the victim in the moving bus in Delhi on the night of 16.12.2012. 1 10 8 28
The High Court confirmed the death sentence by its judgment dated 13.03.2014 and the Supreme Court confirmed the same vide judgment dated 05.05.2017  1 14 3 4 23
According to the petitioner, his conduct in prison and his capacity to reform, is a crucial consideration for mercy. 3 1 2 19
The petitioner’s mercy petition was rejected by the President of India on 17.01.2020 3 10 11 13
Sessions Judge on 17.01.2020 issued a fresh execution warrant directing the petitioner to be executed on 01.02.2020. 3 13 2 17
In response to the application moved through petitioner’s lawyer as well as his RTI application dated 20.01.2020, the Superintendent, Tihar Jail provided the petitioner with the documents pertaining to the petitioner’s mercy petition between 20.01.2020 and 23.01.2020. 4 4 2 37
the relevant materials had not been placed before the President of India and the relevant materials had been kept out of consideration 4 21 2 22 
the petitioner had been kept in solitary confinement and this aspect has not been taken into consideration 5 3 8 17
Refuting the contention of the petitioner, Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General submitted that while forwarding the mercy petition all the relevant materials as laid down in paras 23 and 24.2 of Shatrughan Chauhan have been placed before the President of India. 5 8 1 42
as per the affidavit of the Director General, Prisons, the petitioner was only kept in a single room with iron bars open to air and the petitioner was intermingling with other prisoners as per rules and the same cannot be equated to solitary confinement. 5 15 8 44
The Supreme Court has taken the consistent view that the executive orders under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution should be subject to limited judicial review 8 22 1 27
Although the decision of the President of India under Article 72 of the Constitution of India is open to judicial review but the grounds therefore are very limited 10 4 1 28
documents which would prove the innocence of the petitioner were not placed before the President and thus the relevant materials were kept out of the consideration of the President of India. 12 23 31
Ministry of Home Affairs has filed an affidavit stating that all the relevant documents as laid down in Paras (23) and (24.2) of Shatrughan Chauhan case were placed before the President and after detailed examination, the President has rejected the mercy petition 14 11 2 42
the Superintendent of Jail is the right person to make recommendation as to the conduct of the petitioner in the jail and about his repentance and that the petitioner has reformed 16 13 2 31
The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that Column No. 23 was left blank and thus, the guidelines had not been followed 16 15 10 22
Though Column No.23 relates to recommendation by the Superintendent, Tihar Jail, the word “if any” indicates that the Superintendent may or may not give his remarks/recommendations 17 6 7 28
it is alleged that the petitioner has been in solitary confinement for 08 months and 09 days 20 1 3 17
Director General, Prisons has denied the averment that the petitioner was kept in solitary confinement. It is stated that for security reasons, the petitioner was kept in one ward having multiple single rooms 20 4 2 34
single room had iron bars open to air and the same cannot be equated with solitary confinement/single cell. 20 7 8 19
petitioner has further averred that his brother Ram Singh was actually murdered though his death was projected as “suicide” and that due to death of his brother, the petitioner was living in “perpetual fear”. 21 1 1 34
The alleged sufferings in the prison cannot be a ground for judicial review of the executive order passed under Article 72 of the Constitution rejecting the petitioner’s mercy petition. 21 13 4 29
the petitioner, it was contended that there was non-application of mind and the entire matter proceeded with bias and pre-determined mind 21 18 10 23
contended by the learned Solicitor General, delay in disposal of mercy petition may be a ground calling for judicial review of the order passed under Article 72/161 of the Constitution 23 16 3 31
The writ petition is dismissed accordingly. 24 3 11 6
