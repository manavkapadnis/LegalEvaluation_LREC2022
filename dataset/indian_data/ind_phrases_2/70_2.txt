directed against the order dated 05.05.2009 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay 0 11 3 21
appellant’s plea for quashing disciplinary proceedings and setting­aside a dismissal order on charges of corruption and extraconstitutional conduct while employed as a paramilitary officer, was rejected 0 13 2 26
appellant joined the Central Industrial Security Force 0 18 1 15
deployed in the Crime and Intelligence Wing 1 3 7 12
appellant was specifically entrusted with conducting surprise searches of personnel strict action against anyone indulging in corruption 1 5 3 20
noticed a large bundle of high­denomination notes in Sharma’s pocket 1 10 4 16
a conflicting GD entry had been made at the Main­gate of the BPCL compound a little earlier at around 6:05PM, noting how an amount of Rs 9,000 had been handed over by doghandler Constable KK Sharma (PW­2) on behalf of another official, as personal loan to Sharma 2 1 6 45
FIR was thus registered by the respondent­authorities with the regional Anti­Corruption Branch of the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) on 06.03.1999 under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 2 14 2 37
chargesheet contained three charges against the appellant 3 2 2 7
gross misconduct and indiscipline by virtue of ordering of a false GD Entry 3 3 2 13
becoming an extra­constitutional authority by issuing unlawful orders to Constable KK Sharma to give false statement to substantiate the aforementioned fake GD entry 3 4 10 23
corruption for illegally collecting bribes from contractors of BPCL through his subordinates 3 7 6 12
enquiry officer through report dated 17.09.1999 held the appellant guilty under each of the three charges 6 7 6 17
the enquiry officer concluded that illegal sums were being collected by the appellant from BPCL’s contractors through his subordinate officers and therefore, the third charge of corruption too had been proved 6 19 9 31
disciplinary authority noted that no material contradictions could be pointed out in witnesses’ testimonies, and no compelling alternate evidence had been produced 7 14 2 23
specified serving of a second show cause notice and opportunity of hearing regarding the proposed penalty 10 3 5 32
main witness (CW­1) had retracted his statement 11 6 3 8
no corroboration between witnesses and documents 11 7 5 6
the punishment of dismissal from service is far from disproportionate to the charges of corruption, fabrication and intimidation which have unanimously been proven against the appellant 20 11 3 26
Given the paramilitary nature of the appellant’s force, a sense of integrity, commitment, discipline, and camaraderie is paramount 21 21 9 18
do not find any merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed 22 7 7 13
