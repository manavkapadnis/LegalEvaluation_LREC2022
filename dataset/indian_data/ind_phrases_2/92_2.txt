one Kumurika Nabina informed said PW1 Pradeep that his brother Raghumani was attacked and was lying by the side of a road 0 15 10 22
Pradeep immediately rushed to the place and found cut marks on various parts of the body of said Raghumani who was lying in a pool of blood 0 17 10 27

Police Officer Utkal Ranjan Das (later examined as PW 15) reached the place of occurrence at 8.15 pm and removed 1 8 5 18
while in the police vehicle Raghumani made a statement (Ext. 5) giving the names of the assailantssaid Raghumani to Gunpur Hospital 1 12 5 16
tried for having committed offences punishable under Sections 148, 149 read with Section 302 IPC in Sessions Case No.15 of 1997 in the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Rayagada 1 17 6 30
PWs 4 and 5 were stated to be eye witnesses to the occurrence 2 5 14 13
second set of witnesses were PWs 2, 8 and 9, who were not eye witnesses but were said to be present when the statement was made by the deceased to PW1 Pradeep 2 8 3 32
According to PW14 Dr. Padhy there were fourteen injuries on the person of the deceased, out of which eleven were incised injuries
death was due to haemorrhage and shock resulting from extensive injuries over the body of the deceased
Sessions Court thus convicted them under Section 148 IPC and also under Section 149 read with Section 302 IPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years
The High Court found that the evidence of so called eye-witnesses, namely, PWs 4 and 5 did not inspire confidence as their statements were recorded belatedly
the deceased must have survived only for a short duration after he received the injuries
extremely doubtful whether the deceased had survived long enough for PWs 1 and 15 to arrive at the scene of occurrence and then make separate statements 
appellant is, therefore, entitled to the benefit of doubt. In the circumstances, this appeal is allowed
The judgments and orders passed by the Sessions Court and the High Court are set aside and the appellant is acquitted of all the charges leveled against him
