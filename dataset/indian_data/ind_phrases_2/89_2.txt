A collective assault resulting in the death of one Ajay Kumar Sharma gives rise to these three appeals. 0 15 1 18
The incident occurred in the evening of 9th August, 1996. 0 16 9 10
Cause of his death was stabbing injuries inflicted on him in course of such assault. 0 17 9 15
Sanjeev, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1442 of 2019 arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.3045 of 2010 had, while riding on his two-wheeler hit a cycle cart belonging to one Sanjay, at a location close to the latter’s house in Purana Maujpur under Bhajanpura police station, North East Delhi. 1 2 1 51
Sant Ram, the appellant in the proceeding in Criminal Appeal No.1441 of 2019 arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.3043 of 2010, also reached the spot and took Sanjeev’s side in such quarrel. 1 10 1 33
Dhanpal, Sanjeev and Sant Ram held Ajay and within seconds Kamal assaulted Ajay with a knife on his chest, abdomen and hips. 2 10 5 22
The Trial Court found the three appellants as also Kamal, all four of whom were arraigned as accused persons, guilty under Section 302/34 of Indian Penal Code. 3 8 8 27
The Trial Court primarily relied on eyewitness account of the incident in the depositions of P.W.1(Sanjay), P.W. 3 and P.W. 4 to come to its finding. 3 11 4 27
Sanjay (P.W.1), Narender Kumar (P.W.3) and Sobha Ram (P.W.4) testified as eyewitnesses and gave uniform account of assault on the deceased victim. 3 18 5 22
The Inquiry Officer, Surender Kumar (P.W.19) had reached the hospital and recorded the statement of P.W.1. 4 4 1 16
The actual FIR was registered at 9.30 p.m. in Bhajanpura Police Station. 4 5 8 12
On that basis a case under Section 302/34 was started. 4 6 10 10
Each of the accused persons was sentenced to life imprisonment and subjected to fine of Rs.2,000/- each. 4 12 8 17
On this point, the ratio of the judgment of this Court in the case of Asif Khan vs. State of Maharasthra and Another [(2019) 5 SCC 210] is relevant. 5 15 4 30
In an earlier case, Rajkishore Purohit vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others [(2017) 9 SCC 483], it has been held that to establish common intention to cause murder, overt act or possession of weapons by all the accused persons is not necessary. 5 17 8 43
In the case of Richhpal Singh Meena vs. Ghasi alias Ghisa and Others [(2014) 8 SCC 918], the ratio is that in the event the nature of the assault is such that the target person is likely to die from the injuries resulting therefrom, the accused must be deemed to have known the consequences of his act. 6 3 10 57 
The other factor to which our attention was drawn was delay in registering the FIR. 8 7 2 15
The delay in registering the FIR has been explained properly and judgment of conviction cannot fail for that reason. 9 17 7 19
The appellants are directed to surrender before the Trial Court within six weeks and serve out their sentence. 10 4 10 18
