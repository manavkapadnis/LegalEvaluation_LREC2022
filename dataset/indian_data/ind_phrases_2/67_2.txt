judgment of a Division Bench of the High Court of Chhattisgarh 0 10 1 21
without the authority of law 0 13 1 41
apex body of cooperative banks in the State of Chhattisgarh 1 5 1 18
first respondent is a District Central Cooperative Bank which is governed by the provisions of the Chhattisgarh Co-Operative Societies Act 1960 1 6 9 21
Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 1 9 2 32
appointed the sixth respondent, who was discharging duties as a „Special Class Managing Director‟ at Raipur, as the CEO of the first respondent 1 16 4 28
BoD of the first respondent approved the appointment of the seventh respondent, who was initially serving as the interim CEO, as the CEO 2 6 6 28
first respondent instituted a Writ Petition before the High Court of Chhattisgarh challenging the legality of the order dated 11 August 2017 2 8 10 23
appointment of its CEO lies solely within its discretion and neither the appellant as the apex society nor the Registrar has the power to appoint a CEO 2 11 6 36
appointment made by the appellant of the sixth respondent was in accordance with law and that the order of appointment should be complied with 2 16 12 29
the first respondent filed a Writ Appeal before the Division Bench, which was allowed by the impugned order dated 7 August 2018 3 8 10 22
fault with the appellant for having stepped-in to fill a vacuum when none existed 3 19 5 18
ratification of the appointment by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies was of no consequence 3 20 10 35
CEO of the first respondent  is a paid officer whose appointment is regulated by Section 54(1), which mandates the appointment of only persons who possess the prescribed qualifications 8 18 1 36
Sub-clause (b)(i) of sub-section (2) clearly stipulates that the CEO shall be appointed from among officers in the cadre constituted under Section 54 10 5 6 24
Chairperson of the first respondent appointed a Manager as an interim CEO, who was not from the cadre of officers maintained by the Apex Bank 11 10 11 26
action of the State Cooperative Bank in appointing the CEO of the Central Cooperative Bank is arbitrary and illegal as it is beyond the powers of the State Cooperative Bank under the 1960 Act 15 1 1 35
The present dispute has arisen by virtue of the 2016 Amending Act which inserted clauses (a) and (b) in Section 54(3) of the 1960 Act 17 21 1 25
Clause (a) of subsection (3) stipulates that the eligibility criteria for the post of CEO of a Cooperative Bank are those prescribed by the RBI in this regard 17 22 13 28
Clause (b) stipulates that if the concerned Cooperative Bank fails to appoint a CEO under the eligibility criteria within a specified period, the Registrar may appoint an eligible officer of the Bank 18 1 12 32
seventh respondent is not an officer from the cadre maintained by the appellant. Consequently, the action of the first respondent in seeking to appoint the seventh respondent as the CEO is not sustainable in law 36 6 1 36
allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 7 August 2018 36 12 1 21
